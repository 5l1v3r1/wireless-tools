<H3>3.1.1	 The device</H3>

Even if it uses the same name, the <B>Wavelan IEEE</B> product is
completely different from the old Wavelan (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.html#Wavelan"><I>section 2.1</I></A>),
and totally incompatible in term of protocol and hardware
interface. It is still built by Lucent, and it still operate in the
2.4 GHz ISM band (Direct Sequence), but the new hardware fully support
the IEEE 802.11 protocol (and 802.11-b for the more recent versions)
and is no longer based on a Ethernet MAC chip. There is only a Pcmcia
version (the ISA version uses a ISA to Pcmcia bridge) and the
different access points. Recently, Lucent has added a USB adapter and
mini PCI version of the card for laptop (this one is based on a
PCI-Pcmcia bridge).
<p>

To confuse the issue, Lucent has renamed the Wavelan IEEE as
<B>Orinoco</B> (Wavelan was better IMHO), and this division was part
of Lucent spin-off into a new company called
<B>Agere</B>. <B>Avaya</B> (another Lucent spin-off) is also selling
the Orinoco. Enterasys is also selling the Wavelan IEEE as
<B>RoamAbout 802</B> (a company formerly known as Cabletron, which was
the former DEC networking division). Elsa is selling it in Europe as
<B>AirLancer 11</B> (on the other hand, the 2 Mb/s version is quite
different). In Japan (and maybe also in Europe), Melco is selling it
as <B>Buffalo WLI-PCM-L11</B>. Lately, more vendors have been joining
the club, such as HP (<B>HP 802.11b Wireless LAN</B>), IBM (<B>IBM
High Rate Wireless LAN</B>), Dell (<B>Dell TrueMobile 1150</B> - on
the other hand, the 1100 is an <A HREF="#Arlan802"><I>Aironet</I></A>
card), Compaq (<B>Compaq WL 110, WL 210 and WL 215</B> - the WL100 and
WL200 are <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>PrismII</I></A> based), 1stWave
(<B>1stWave PC-Card</B>) and ARtem (<B>ARtem ComCard</B>).  The Apple
<B>Airport</B> is also derived from the Wavelan IEEE (see <A
HREF="#Airport"><I>section 3.5</I></A>).
<p>
The Wavelan IEEE saga never ends. <B>Proxim</B> bought the card and
access point business of Agere (Agere kept the chipset and radio
part), so now the same Orinoco cards are sold by Proxim under the name
<B>Orinoco Classic</B> or <B>Orinoco World</B> (841X - with the big
square antenna and using the same Agere Hermes chipset). In a bold
marketing move, Proxim renamed all it's other lines of wireless cards
as Orinoco, however those cards are not based on the Agere chipset but
on <B>Atheros</B> chipset (846X, 847X and 848X). The <B>Orinoco
11b</B> (842X - 802.11b only with a short antenna) are based on the
Agere HermesII chipset, which is different from the old chipset (and
therefore not compatible with the usual Orinoco drivers). So, if the
Proxim Orinoco card doesn't have a big square antenna and do support
802.11a or 802.11g, you can be sure it's not a <B>true Orinoco</B>.
<p>
The Wavelan IEEE appears to the PC as a standard network card and
interfaces naturally with the networking stack. The configuration
includes only setting the network name (ESSID), the rest is automatic
(finding the equivalent BSSID and channel). As usual for Lucent, the
documentation and website are rich.
<p>
The Lucent Wavelan IEEE is based on the Lucent Hermes chipset. As with
all IEEE 802.11 products, the Hermes offer a fully featured MAC
protocol, including MAC level acknowledgement (good news for all of us
having dealt with the old Wavelan card), optional RTS/CTS,
fragmentation, automatic rate selection, roaming. This seems
exhaustive, but is mandatory for IEEE 802.11 compliance. Different
version of the card include different level of security (bronze is
basic, silver is with WEP (RC4-40 bits) and gold is with proprietary
128 bit encryption.
<p>
The MAC support both Managed and <B>Ad-Hoc modes</B>. However, the
initial firmware for those cards did support only a non-compliant
Ad-Hoc mode (called Ad-Hoc demo mode - which interoperate with most
PrismII cards). In order to gain WiFi compliance, Lucent added in
recent firmware (6.06 and greater) a second Ad-Hoc mode which is fully
802.11 compliant (called Peer to Peer mode or IBSS Ad-Hoc mode - and
which interoperate with Aironet cards). Of course, the two Ad-Hoc
modes are not interoperable.
<p>
The 2.4 GHz modem is an enhanced version of the previous generation,
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (11 chips encoding), using both 1 and
2 Mb/s signalling rate (using effectively 22 MHz of bandwidth) and 5.5
and 11 Mb/s in second generation cards, diversity antennas and with 13
different frequencies (depending on the regulations).
<p>
Initially, the Wavelan was only offering 1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s bit rates
(basic IEEE 802.11 DS standard). For a while, Lucent was also selling
a "turbo" version of the card, which was adding 5 and 10&nbsp;Mb/s
bit-rates for shorter range using Lucent proprietary modulations (so,
not compatible with 802.11-b).
<p>
Later, Lucent introduced the second generation of the Wavelan IEEE,
still based on the same Hermes chipset, which is much cheaper and
fully compliant with the new <B>802.11-b</B> standard, supporting 1,
2, 5.5 and 11&nbsp;Mb/s bit-rate (compatible with other 11&nbsp;Mb/s
products).
<p>
All Wavelan IEEE cards do not offer the exact same set of features,
because Lucent keep changing the <B>firmware</B>. From firmware
<B>1.00</B> to <B>4.52</B>, Lucent was mostly adding features
(encryption, power saving) and keeping it backward compatible, but
firmware <B>6.04</B> and later created a major
incompatibility. Firmware <B>6.06</B> and later implement a fully
802.11 compliant IBSS Ad-Hoc mode (on top of the Ad-Hoc demo
mode). Firmware <B>6.04</B> dropped Fragmentation Threshold setting in
favor of microwave oven robustness (an automatic fragmentation
scheme). Firmware <B>6.16</B> did fix a few bugs with the IBSS Ad-Hoc
mode (security, ESSID="any").
<p>
Agere has recently released a new <B>HermesII</B> chipset, derived
from the venerable Hermes chipset. The most notable improvements are a
higher integration (smaller & cheaper), a PCI interface with DMA
support and a USB interface. The chip interface and firmware is not
compatible with the old Hermes chipset, requiring specific driver
support for HermesII. To my knowledge, this chipset is only used in
the Proxim 842X cards.


<H3>3.1.2	  The driver</H3>

<I>Andreas Neuhaus</I> is no longer working to improve this driver,
therefore it's now discontinued in favor of the new Orinoco driver
(see <A HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section 3</I></A>). The driver is based on
Lucent source code, which is a cut down version of their full
driver. So, it lacks all the part about handling natively 802.11
frames and Lucent proprietary API, and initially it lacked some of the
more fancy features of Lucent's driver, but <I>Andreas</I> is adding
them slowly. Of course, the driver support all version of the card
(bronze, silver, gold - basic, turbo, turbo 11 Mb/s) and is fully
interoperable with Access Points and Windows nodes.
<p>
<I>Andreas</I> has done a very good job into providing features like
Wireless Extensions (I must admit that I did help him quite a bit ;-)
and many configuration parameters (station name, channel, mtu
size). The new version adds Power management and encryption setting,
change of the operating mode via Wireless Extensions, promiscuous and
multicast support...
<p>
<I>Andreas</I> has done a lot of debugging of the driver and it seems
now much more stable. Lastly, the ISA to Pcmcia and PCI to Pcmcia
bridges may be a source troubles under Linux. The latest version of
the driver fixes SMP support, multi-cards configuration, improve
wireless.opts support, add IBSS Ad-Hoc mode support and support
properly and sanely the various firmware releases.
<p>
<I>Harald Roelle</I> has developped a patch for this driver in order
to fully support the PPC architecture. This patch mostly contain some
bit order fixes. This patch should help other architecture with
endianess issues. His patch was eventually integrated (with major
changes) by <I>David Hinds</I> in version 1.0.6 of the driver. I added
firmware detection support in 1.0.6 to properly handle all the various
firmware releases and their variations (in particular the two Ad-Hoc
modes), and fixed the remaining SMP bugs.
<p>
The driver does not support the USB and Mini-PCI version of the
Wavelan.
<p>
Nowadays, <I>Anton Blanchard</I> is the official maintainer of the
driver, with the help of <I>David Gibson</I>. <I>David</I> has done a
complete rewrite of the driver (see <A HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section
3.2</I></A>), so this driver won't be maintained anymore...
<p>
<I>Moustafa</I> has released a version of this driver with scanning
support.
<p>
<B>Note</B> that Lucent has also released a binary library driver (see
<A HREF="#WavelanIEEEbin"><I>section 3.3</I></A>) which is maybe more
solid and performant than the driver of <I>Andreas</I> but lack
complete support for Wireless Extensions.

<H3>3.2.1	 The device</H3>

As explained in various sections, Lucent Wavelan-IEEE/Orinoco devices
(see <A HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 3.1</I></A>), Intersil PrismII
devices (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>) and Symbol High
Rate devices (see <A HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 3.10</I></A>) are
basically using the <B>same MAC controller</B>. This driver attempt to
support all those devices, which are described in details in their own
sections.
<p>
However, even though those devices use the same MAC controller and the
same driver, those devices are not the same. Each vendor has its own
<B>firmware</B>, so the set of features of those cards vary. Some
differences are visible to the user (for example 128 bits key
support), some are more related to performance and robustness tuning
of the MAC.
<p>
Moreover, those devices don't use the same <B>radio modem</B> (mostly
Lucent or Intersil) and same antennas. For PrismII cards, even the
actual layout of the radio components on the card can make a huge
difference. This will mostly translate into difference of
<B>coverage</B> between the various cards (range and resistance to
interference). The range between some cards may vary by a factor 2 in
some conditions.

<H3>3.2.2	  The driver</H3>

<I>Anton Blanchard</I> and <I>David Gibson</I> became official
maintainers of the wvlan_cs driver (see <A
HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 3.1</I></A>) in the end of
2000. <I>David</I> was not very happy about the state of wvlan_cs.
<p>
The HCF (the low level library provided by Lucent) hadn't been
maintained since the initial release of the driver and was quite
difficult to read and understand. While the higher layer of the driver
had gone a long way and were robust and fully featured, the HCF was a
mess and the cause of many problems (TxTimeout, driver
corruption/crashes and else).
<p>
Rather than put up with that, David looked deeply in the low level of
the <B>wlan-ng</B> driver from Mark (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section
3.6</I></A>) and the FreeBSD driver and wrote a totally new driver
combining a new low level core and the high level features of
wvlan_cs. The end result was a driver much more readable, robust and
well behaved than wvlan_cs. In the process, David added support for
PrismII cards. Then, I fixed a few Wireless Extensions bugs, added
some support for Symbol cards, and we pushed the driver in the
kernel. The driver was initially named <B>dldwd_cs</B> and was renamed
<B>orinoco_cs</B> at this point. Later on, <I>David Hinds</I> backported this
driver to the Pcmcia package for users of earlier kernels.
<p>
The main goal of the driver is to support <B>Wavelan IEEE/Orinoco
cards</B> and OEM. The driver support all the firmwares and features
of those cards properly and fully (Ad-Hoc demo mode, IBSS mode,
bit-rate, encryption keys...), and support all the features available
in wvlan_cs (except module parameters) with less bugs.
<p>
<I>Ben</I> has added Airport support to this driver (see <A
HREF="#Airport"><I>section 3.5</I></A>), and the support of those cards
is similar to Orinoco cards (i.e. most features supported properly).
<p>
Starting in release v0.6d, the support of <B>Symbol cards</B> and OEM
is complete, at least for firmware 1.5 and 1.7. Bit rate, mode of
operation (managed, ad-hoc IBSS and ad-hoc demo), encryption and power
management are fully working. The release v0.8 added full support for
later Symbol firmware 2.00 and 2.20. On firmware 2.20 and later, Power
Management is disabled. Version of the driver from <B>v0.10 to v0.12b
don't work</B> properly with Symbol cards due to a bug, so avoid those
releases. <B>Symbol CF cards</B> are very different and supported in
their own driver (see <A HREF="#SpectrumCF"><I>section 3.13</I></A>).
<p>
The support of <B>PrismII cards</B> and clones is in progress. More
debugging and testing need to be done, but the driver can set most
features to some degree (Ad-Hoc demo mode, IBSS mode, bit-rate,
encryption keys have been seen to work). It seems the upgrading
firmware fixes problems related to encryption. However, the
<I>wlan-ng</I> and <I>HostAP</I> drivers still have more features and
are more tested...
<p>
Starting in release v0.8, the orinoco driver collection also support
<B>PLX adapters</B> that are sold with some PrismII cards (via the
<I>orinoco_plx</I> driver). Those adapters are not real Pcmcia
adapters and the card looks to the system like a PCI card. The driver
also support Pcmcia cards in regular ISA to Pcmcia or PCI to Pcmcia
adapters, as long the <B>Pcmcia adapter</B> is recognised and
configured properly by the Pcmcia package (which might be tricky).
<p>
Starting in release v0.11a, the orinoco driver collection also support
<B>PCI cards</B> (all of them being PrismII cards - via the
<I>orinoco_pci</I> driver). The standard driver does not support the
various <B>USB</B> versions of the cards. There is various kind of
<B>MiniPCI</B> implementation of the card, the driver support some of
them (Pcmcia based - Lucent ; PCI based - PrismII) but not most (USB
based - PrismII).
<p>
The latest version (v0.13b) seems to have fix most of the hardware
reset problems of previous versions and seems to have fixed problems
with Symbol firmwares. <I>Pavel</I> has integrated in v0.14 many
previously external patches, such as as support for <B>Wireless
Scanning</B> and Wireless Events, support for <B>Monitor mode</B> and
support for <B>802.1x</B>. <I>Pavel</I> also fixed support for kernel
2.6.X, dramatically improved Symbol firmware support and fixed a tons
of bugs in v0.14.
<p>
Version 0.15-rc2 of the driver was merged into kernel 2.6.12. This
brought all the features and bugfix above in the kernel. Since then,
<I>Pavel</I> is continuing to fix and update the driver, pushing those
changes into recent kernels, but he is no longer using version number
(so I guess we are still at 0.15).

<H3>3.3.1	  The device</H3>

This is the same device as the previous entry (<A
HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 3.1</I></A>).

<H3>3.3.2	  The driver</H3>

<I>Lucent</I> has decided to not put all its eggs in the same basket
and developed a bold strategy for the support of the Wavelan IEEE
under Linux. Not only they have released some source code to allow the
source driver mentioned above, but they have as well contracted
<I>Dean</I> to release a driver based on a binary library. This gives
Linux users the choice, a GPL full source driver to hack with and a
stable full featured binary driver (the official term from Lucent is
``Linux Driver Source/Library'').
<p>
<I>Dean</I> has written the code interfacing between Linux and the
library, and has put together a nice package easy to install and with
documentation. As expected, the binary driver is probably more stable
and than the full source driver mentioned above, with a slightly
different set of feature, and offers all the features of Lucent Window
drivers, plus a nice integration with Linux. This driver supports both
the basic version of the card and the "turbo". The major drawback is
the binary core, preventing the use on other architectures (PPC,
Arm...).
<p>
Now, the driver is supported by Lucent, and they keep adding in it the
same features they add to the Windows drivers (such as microwave oven
robustness). Their also have added support for the IBSS Ad-Hoc mode
(see discussion above). The latest version adds support for 2.4 kernel
and many common Wireless Extensions. Note that Enterasys/Cabletron is
also distributing a slightly modified version of this driver (usually
an older one).
<p>
<I>Moustafa</I> has released a version of this driver with scanning
support.
<p>
Recently, <I>Agere</I> has released a new version of this driver which
is fully Open Source. This new version has support for the
<B>HermesII</B> chipset found in the Proxim Orinoco 842X cards (but it
seems it no longer support the old Orinoco cards - use the older
driver version). It has also improved Wireless Extension
support. <I>Agere</I> is still working hard on the driver and has
recently added support for Wireless Scanning and WPA.

<H3>3.4.1	 The device</H3>

The Orinoco-USB is of course related to other
<B>Wavelan-IEEE/Orinoco</B> devices (see <A
HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 3.1</I></A>). As most first generation
USB designs, it is really a standard Orinoco Pcmcia card plugged into
a <B>Cypress EZ-USB</B> USB-Pcmcia bridge. Such a setup of course
brings some performance degradation due to USB high latency. The
Orinoco card inside the device has the same exact features as other
Orinoco Pcmcia cards and is 802.11b compliant.
<p>
Lucent, Agere and Proxim are directly selling this <B>Orinoco</B>
device. HP/Compaq sells it as <B>WL215</B> (standalone) and
<B>W200</B> (multiport option for Compaq laptops). Other vendors such
as Melco are also selling this hardware. One of the particularity of
this hardware is that the USB-Pcmcia bridge doesn't contain a
firmware, so the driver need to upload the firmware at power up. On
the other hand, the Pcmcia card behind the USB-Pcmcia bridge already
contains its own firmware.
<p>
Note that most USB 802.11b cards are based on either the Intersil
PrismII chipset (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>) or the
Atmel chipset (see <A HREF="#Atmel"><I>section 3.20</I></A>), and are
quite different from this hardware.

<H3>3.4.2	  The driver</H3>

Manuel has managed to reverse engineer the Orinoco USB hardware and is
providing a modified version of the Orinoco driver for Orinoco USB
adapters. This driver only support <B>Orinoco USB</B> hardware, and
not other USB cards. Because it is based on the Orinoco driver (see <A
HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section 3.2</I></A>), this driver offer the same
extended feature set, such as Wireless Extension support.
<p>
The big difference with the standard Orinoco driver is <B>firmware
uploading</B>. You will need to extract the firmware for the
USB-Pcmcia bridge from the Windows driver using the tools provided on
the driver web page. The firmware uploading support in Linux needed
for this driver is currently being finalised, so check the latest
driver documentation. On the other hand, the driver offer no support
for updating the firmware in the Pcmcia card.
<p>
This driver was merged into the CVS of the <B>Orinoco driver</B> (see
<A HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section 3.2</I></A>). However, because the
Orinoco maintainers are not happy with the locking strategy of this
driver, this driver was never included in any release of the Orinoco
driver and is not included in the kernel. The latest version of the
driver may be found in the Orinoco CVS (see <A
HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section 3.2</I></A>).

<H3>3.5.1	 The device</H3>

The Apple <B>AirPort</B> is in fact the Lucent <B>Wavelan IEEE</B>
repackaged, so has the same characteristic as the Wavelan (see <A
HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 3.1</I></A>). All Airport hardware is
802.11-b compliant (second generation of Wavelan IEEE) and support 11
Mb/s, and Apple seem to offer only the version with 40 bit encryption.
<p>
The AirPort card for the most Apple hardware is the OEM version of the
Wavelan IEEE, but it uses a specific slot in those computers and the
antennas are pre-integrated in the host. Most recent Apple machines
offer this interface (iBook, PowerBook 2000 (aka Pismo), AGP G4s,
recent iMacs (DV/SE)...). Note that this interface is <B>not Pcmcia
compatible</B> even is the connector is the same, so this card can't
be used in the normal PC-Card slot of other laptops. This is why this
card work only in specific Apple hardware slot and only with a
specific driver.
<p>
The Access Point (the famous flying saucer) is similar in
functionality to the Lucent RG-1000 Residential Gateway, and is fully
interoperable with other 802.11-b hardware.

<H3>3.5.2	  The driver</H3>

The <B>first version</B> of the Airport driver was done by <I>Benjamin
Herrenschmidt</I> by porting the driver of <I>Andreas Neuhaus</I> (see
<A HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 3.1</I></A>) to support the Apple
Aiport card. He has basically integrated the specific PPC patch of
<I>Harald Roelle</I>, thrown away all the Pcmcia code and replaced it
with the specific Apple initialisation code.
<p>
Apart from that, the driver is basically the same, with the same
features and same bug ;-)
<p>
The <B>second version</B> of the driver was also done by <I>Benjamin
Herrenschmidt</I> and is just a wrapper on top of the driver of
<I>David Gibson</I> (see <A HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section 3.2</I></A>),
and was integrated in version 0.05 (kernel 2.4.5). This is a much
cleaner solution, because both driver share the same source, so the
feature set is identical and all improvements and bug fixes of the
Orinoco driver are automatically in the Airport driver and
vice-versa. For example, this driver gained both <B>Scanning</B> and
<B>Monitor mode</B> support in version 0.14 and later.

</TABLE>

<H3>3.6.1	 The device</H3>

The PrismII chipset is the successor of the PrismI chipset, described
in the previous section (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.html#Prism"><I>section 2.4</I></A>), and
is build by Intersil (formerly Harris). Intersil offer this chipset
and some reference design to various OEM, allowing them to build
various 802.11-b products (cards or integrated in their own
products). I expect that all the people that were formerly using the
PrismI chipset will switch sooner or later to the PrismII.
<p>
The first manufacturers to offer PrismII cards were <B>Samsung</B> and
<B>Compaq</B> (WL100, WL200, rumored to be a rebadged Samsung card),
with a Pcmcia card, a PCI card and an Access Point. Other Prism
vendors like <B>ZoomAir</B>, <B>Nokia</B> and <B>GemTek</B> did
release later their own version of the PrismII cards, as well as
<B>Proxim</B> (RangeLAN DS, Harmony 802.11b...). Some big networking
vendors like <B>D-Link</B>, <B>LinkSys</B>, <B>NetGear</B> and
<B>SMC</B> were also quick to jump on this new opportunity for them,
as well as many smaller vendors like <B>AddTron</B>, <B>Ambicom</B>,
<B>Teletronics</B>, <B>Ampwave</B> and many other that I can't
list... The rule of thumb is that if your card is not listed in
another section of the Howto, it could be a PrismII card (or not, see
below).
<p>
Some notable exceptions which are <B>not</B> PrismII cards : the
<B>Compaq WL 110, WL 210 and WL 215 cards</B> (which are
<I>Orinoco</I> cards), the <B>D-Link 650H</B> (which is a
<I>Symbol</I> card), most <B>D-Link/LinkSys/SMC USB</B> cards (which
are <I>Atmel</I> cards), the <B>SMC 2632W-v2</B> (which is an
<I>Atmel</I> card), all <B>22&nbsp;Mb/s</B> cards such as the
<B>D-Link 650+/520+</B> (based on the <I>TI chipset</I>), all
<B>CardBus</B> cards such as the <B>new D-Link 650</B> (which is an
<I>ADMtek</I> card), all <B>802.11a</B> cards (which are
<I>Atheros</I> or <I>Intersil PrismDuette</I> cards) and all
<B>802.11g</B> cards (which are <I>Broadcom</I>, <I>Atheros</I> or
<I>Intersil PrismGT</I> cards). In fact, so many vendors seem to be
moving away from the PrismII chipset (usually without warning and
without changing the model name) and there is so many changes
happening that it's impossible to keep track of who is using what.
<p>
Please note that everything that <B>looks like a PrismII card</B> may
not be a PrismII card, and many people are quite confused about
that. The cards described in this section use both a Intersil PrismII
chipset and an Intersil firmware. Other vendors, such as Lucent (see
<A HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 3.1</I></A>), Aironet (see <A
HREF="#Arlan802"><I>section 3.14</I></A>), Symbol (see <A
HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 3.10</I></A>) and Atmel (see <A
HREF="#Atmel"><I>section 3.20</I></A>) use part of the PrismII chipset
but with their own firmware and therefore are <B>not compatible</B>
(even if they sometime use the same device identification as PrismII
cards and sort of work with PrismII drivers).
<p>
Most PrismII vendors offer regular <I>Pcmcia cards</I> for
laptops. For desktop machines, the situation is a bit more messy, some
vendors offer standard <I>PCI-Pcmcia cards</I> (where you can slot the
Pcmcia card), dedicated <I>PLX cards</I> (that look like a regular
PCI-Pcmcia bridge but is not) or some <I>fully integrated PCI
cards</I> (Prism2.5). Some vendors also offer <I>USB adapters</I>
(beware, some of them are <I>Amtel</I> cards, and all of them have
performance issues). Lastly, some laptop include <I>MiniPCI cards</I>
that may be either integrated PCI cards or USB adapters.
<p>
Like the initial PrismI design, the PrismII is fully compatible with
802.11 and include a 2.4 GHz Direct Sequence modem, with all the usual
features (Roaming, WEP...).
<p>
The main differences between the PrismI and PrismII chipset are a
higher integration, a higher performance modem and the replacement of
the AMD controller with Intersil own design. The higher integration (5
chips instead of 8) allows to reduce the price and the size of the
product, and to simplify the integration. The new physical layer
(modem) has a better performance (but a lower transmit power),
increasing range, speed and battery life, and is fully compliant with
the 802.11-b standard (5.5 and 11 Mb/s). Finally, the new MAC
controller handle most of the 802.11 functionality (instead of leaving
it to the driver), which simplify driver development and help
performance on slow devices (palmtop, embedded design).
<p>
The <B>Prism2.5</B> and <B>Prism3</B> chipsets are evolution of the
PrismII chipset, offering even higher integration, lower cost and
backward compatibility. With respect to the driver, these 3 chipset
look the same, and therefore driver supporting PrismII hardware will
also support Prism2.5 and Prism3 hardware.
<p>
Note that the PrismII <B>firmwares</B> are usually not of the highest
quality and quite inconsistent from one release to another, both on
the cards and on the Access Points, and you may have to try a few of
them before finding the one that work for you. For example, encryption
and IBSS ad-hoc mode seems to be working only in the latest firmwares
(0.8.3 and later), and multicast is not working at all. It also
usually takes a bit of time to get the workaround for the latest
firmwares in the various Linux drivers. Latest firmware seem to have
fixed most problems and have added the feature missing from earlier
firmwares.
<p>
A few words about <B>Ad-Hoc modes</B>&nbsp;: like for Orinoco card,
the firmware support two ad-hoc mode, the Ad-Hoc demo mode (not
802.11-b compliant, but reported to be Orinoco Ad-Hoc demo mode
compatible) and the IBSS Ad-Hoc mode (802.11-b compliant). The IBSS
Ad-Hoc mode is only available in firmwares 0.8.3 and later.

<H3>3.6.2 The driver</H3>

Who was more qualified to write this driver than <I>Mark</I>, from
AVS, who already wrote the driver for the PrimsI cards&nbsp;? In fact,
Intersil did partner with <I>Mark</I> to get this driver written for
us&nbsp;!
<p>
As usual with <I>Mark</I>, the driver is really complete and well
written. It is currently only in beta stage, and <I>Mark</I> told me
that he needs to add more documentation and debug some more
features. The driver support both Pcmcia and PCI cards. This driver is
compatible with Linux bridging software, includes a generic 802.11
interface, exposing the full 802.11 MIB to user space, and include
hooks to build an Access Point. The driver also come with a
configuration tools, an utility to dump 802.11 frames and a daemon
responding to 802.11 events.
<p>
The release 0.1.10 fixes a number of long standing problems and
include a number of patches and features that were floating around on
the mailing lists. This version supports properly WEP encryption and
Ad-Hoc mode. Note that the driver supports only <B>IBSS ad-hoc</B>
mode (0.1.10 and later) and only for recent firmwares, whereas most
cards also support the old ad-hoc demo mode.
<p>
The driver supports <B>Pcmcia, PLX and PCI cards</B>. The
PLX card allow to add a Pcmcia card in a PCI slot, but does not
support any of the Pcmcia functionality, so is not supported through
the Pcmcia package but directly by the driver. PCI support is for
fully integrated PCI cards or MiniPCI cards. <I>Mark</I> has also
added <B>USB support</B> (only for Intersil USB cards, not Atmel
cards).
<p>
<I>Reyk</I> has developped a patch that adds basic Wireless Extension
support to the driver, and that was included in version 0.1.13. He
needs help for testing and improving it.
<p>
Since then, <I>Mark</I> is concentrating on a Intersil 802.11a driver
(not Atheros) and has transferred the maintenance of the driver to
<I>Solomon</I> (a new AVS employee). <I>Solomon</I> is making the
driver SMP compliant, cleaning it up and keeping up with the new
firmwares from Intersil, and keeping up with new
kernels. <I>Solomon</I> has also added pretty complete support for
<B>Wireless Extensions</B> in 0.2.1, including Scanning support.
<p>
<I>Mark</I> is also selling a Wireless Development kit and an Access
Point, based on a PPC platform and this driver.

</TABLE>

<H3>3.8.1	 The device</H3>

This is the same device as the previous entry (<A
HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>).
<p>
One of the most interesting feature of the standard PrismII firmware
is that it can allow the host to act as an Access Point (<B>HostAP
mode</B>). This allow to turn a regular PC with a Prism2 cards into an
Access Point, allowing other nodes to connect to it. In HostAP mode,
the card does only the critical part of the Access Point (sending
beacons) and simply pass all the 802.11 management frames to the
driver (which does 802.11 management itself).
<p>
Note that this HostAP mode doesn't exist or is not documented for
other cards (non-PrismII firmwares). Also, it is possible to load
special firmware in PrismII card which allows the card to perform the
full Access Point functionality by itself (tertiary firmware).

<H3>3.8.2 The driver</H3>

<I>Jouni</I> has recently written this totally new driver for PrismII
card. It is well written, it was probably inspired by the various
other driver floating around and is much more simpler than the
linux-wlan-ng driver (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>).
<p>
The driver has complete support for the various feature of the PrismII
card (WEP, IBSS Ad-Hoc mode, scanning...), Monitor mode, very complete
support for Wireless Extensions and offer various extra information in
a <U>/proc</U> directory, making already an excellent choice for a
standard wireless client.
<p>
What set this driver apart from the other driver is its support for
HostAP mode. In this mode, the driver act as an Access Point on the
air and does all the 802.11 management necessary. In this mode, the
driver also allows bridging through the regular Ethernet bridge driver
of Linux. This explain why this driver is use by most Linux
Access-Point projects.
<p>
<I>Jouni</I> continues to refine his driver and has added PLX and PCI
cards support, monitor mode, MAC address based access list and WDS
support (to allow Access Point to communicate with each
other). <I>Jouni</I> latest masterpiece is the addition of <B>WPA
support</B> in the HostAP driver, and the associated user space
wpa_supplicant.
<p>
In other words : impressive work...
<p>
This driver was included in kernel 2.6.14, and has been maintained in
the kernel since without increasing the version number.

<H3>3.9.1	 The device</H3>

The Samsung <B>MagicLAN</B> is one of the various products based on
the Intersil PrismII chipset (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section
3.6</I></A> for full details). It's a fully featured wireless lan
compliant with 802.11-b. The Compaq products are rumored to be the
Samsung one, with a new sticker...

<H3>3.9.2 The driver</H3>

Samsung has released their own version of a PrismII driver for their
card. The driver seems complete and well written, the new releases
fixes more bugs and I had report of people successfully using it (with
Samsung cards and even some LinkSys and D-Link cards).
<p>
The main difference with the PrismII driver of <I>Mark</I> (see <A
HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>) is that the Samsung driver is
based on a binary library (so, only available on x86 platforms), offer
encryption and Ad-Hoc mode and offer some support for Wireless
Extensions.

<H3>3.10.1	 The device</H3>

Despite being a long time proponent of Frequency Hopping, Symbol
couldn't ignore the success of 802.11-b. After a strategic agreement
with Intel, Symbol is back with a complete line of 802.11-b products,
that are called <B>Spectrum24 High Rate</B> (to better confuse them
with their old FH products). Symbol still sell mostly to vertical
markets through VAR, but both 3Com and Intel are repackaging Symbol
cards, as <B>Intel PRO/Wireless</B> and <B>3Com AirConnect</B>.  The
Symbol CF card is also sold by <B>Socket Communications</B>.
<p>
Of course, there are exceptions&nbsp;: the <B>Symbol/Socket CF</B>
cards (Compact Flash) and the Intel <B>2011B</B> card don't have a
built in firmware and require a specific version of the driver (called
CF). On the other hand, the <B>3Com/Intel PCI cards</B> are <A
HREF="#Prism2"><I>PrismII</I></A> cards, and the latest 3Com 802.11b
cards include various chipsets (see <A HREF="#Poldhu"><I>section
3.18</I></A>).
<p>
The card is mostly sold in the Pcmcia form factor, along with the
Access Point. There is a PCI version that looks like a Pcmcia card in
a regular PCI to Pcmcia slot.  The main originality of Symbol is that
it offer those famous "all-in-one" products (PDA + barcode + wireless)
with 802.11-b (beware, they share the same model numbers as the
non-802.11b devices). Recently Symbol released a <B>Compact Flash</B>
(CF) version of their card called Wireless Networker which has an
amazing form factor.
<p>
The Symbol product is composed of the Intersil PrismII chipset (see
<A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>) with Symbol own MAC controller
(which is originally derived from the same core as the MAC from
Lucent, Aironet and Intersil). From Symbol, we can expect a design
giving good quality and performance.
<p>
The MAC has all the usual features of the 802.11 standard, like MAC
level retransmission, RTS/CTS, fragmentation, auto bit-rate selection,
power saving, WEP encryption and roaming, which extensive
configurability. The physical layer has the classic PrismII feature,
supporting 1, 2, 5.5 and 11&nbsp;Mb/s.

<H3>3.10.2	 The driver</H3>

The driver was initially written by TriplePoint, and <I>Lee</I> has
taken over the maintenance. Not surprisingly, the driver is very
similar to the Wavelan-IEEE binary driver (except for being full
source), to the point of mentioning "Turbo" cards (what Symbol calls
"High Rate").
<p>
The driver is well written, has an extensive collection of module
parameters and has been tested successfully with Symbol, 3Com and
Intel cards. <I>Lee</I> plans to add Wireless Extensions and fix the
few remaining bugs...
<p>
The version 1.01 of the driver fixes some bugs related to higher bit
rate (11 Mb/s) and encryption. The version 1.02, adds support for
kernel 2.4.X and disable power management (doesn't work on latest
firmwares).
<p>
Symbol has recently release a separate version of this driver to
support <B>Compact Flash</B> cards. Compact Flash cards need a
specific driver because they don't have the firmware stored on the
card and therefore the driver has to download the firmware to the card
after each reset.

<H3>3.11.1	 The device</H3>

After their success with wide area communications (GSM and co.),
Ericsson decided to expand in new markets and started looking
seriously at local connectivity. Ericsson is of course the main
driving force behind <B>BlueTooth</B> (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.std.html#mclink"><I>section 8</I></A>), but they
realised pretty quickly the BlueTooth would not fulfil the need of the
Wireless LAN market. Ericsson is also pushing hard <B>HiperLAN II</B>
(see <A HREF="Linux.Wireless.std.html#Hiperlan2"><I>section
8</I></A>), a high performance system (54 Mb/s) in the 5 GHz band with
strong quality of service support.
<p>
The initial Ericsson Wireless LAN products were OEM of <B>BreezeCom
pro.11</B> products (Frequency Hopping, 3&nbsp;Mb/s - see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.html#BreezeNetPC"><I>section
2.11</I></A>). Due to the success of 802.11-b, their second product
line are fully 802.11-b compliant, and are in fact OEM of the Symbol
cards (see <A HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 3.10</I></A>). As such,
this product has all the usual 802.11-b features...

<H3>3.11.2	 The driver</H3>

This driver apply only to the 11&nbsp;Mb/s version of the Ericsson
card. This is only the second driver written by <I>Christian</I> from
scratch, after the BreezeCom driver (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.html#BreezeNetPC"><I>section 2.11</I></A>
- this other driver applies to Ericsson 3&nbsp;Mb/s cards). And as
usual for him, the source code is well written, concise and
clean. Impressive job !
<p>
This driver is very new, so I don't have yet report of its use. The
driver seems to support only a minimal set of configuration and
statistics for now. <I>Christian</I> told me that it should work with
other Symbol cards with minor changes, and that the driver has been
tested with IPsec and MobileIP. I hope to have more info about it at a
later date...

<H3>3.13.1	 The device</H3>

This is the same device as the previous entry (<A
HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 3.10</I></A>).
<p>
Note that this driver is specific to the <B>Compact Flash</B> (CF)
version of the card and the <B>Intel 2011B</B>.

<H3>3.13.2	 The driver</H3>

The Orinoco driver (see <A HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section 3.2</I></A>)
already includes support for regular Symbol HR cards. However, the
Compact Flash cards don't work with the standard Orinoco driver
because they lack built in firmware. This is the same reason why there
is two different Spectrum24 drivers (see <A
HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 3.10</I></A>).
<p>
Pavel has created a new driver based on the Orinoco driver and
Spectrum24-CF driver for those cards. It is similar to the regular
Orinoco Pcmcia driver, but add the <B>firmware download</B> at each
reset necessary for those cards. As the core of the driver is common
with the <B>Orinoco driver</B>, this driver has the exact same feature
set (which is quite extensive - see <A HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section
3.2</I></A>). This driver is now integrated in the Orinoco driver
collection (v0.14 and later), and no longer distributed separately. It
is now part of the Linux kernel (2.6.14 and later).
<p>
Note that for cards that don't require the firmware download (regular
Pcmcia cards), it is recommended to use the regular Orinoco driver
instead of this one.

<H3>3.14.1	 The device</H3>

Aironet has been the producer of some of the most performant wireless
LANs for a long time. Aironet was a division of Telxon, and was
spun-off when Symbol, one of their competitor, did aquire
Telxon. After a short independent life, Aironet was acquired by Cisco.
<p>
The previous section was dealing with Aironet old pre-802.11 products
(see <A HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.html#Arlan"><I>section
2.8</I></A>), this section deals with their more recent 802.11
compliant products. Their first 802.11 products were the 3500 family,
Frequency Hopping (1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s), and 4500, Direct Sequence (1
and 2&nbsp;Mb/s).
<p>
The Arlan <B>4500</B> family is 802.11 compliant wireless LANs in the
2.4&nbsp;GHz ISM band, and is Direct Sequence. It includes an ISA,
PCI, Pcmcia, serial, Ethernet and multi-Ethernet versions, plus the
Access Point.
<p>
These cards are based on the Harris <B>Prism</B> chipset, like many
other cards (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.html#Prism"><I>section 2.4</I></A>), but
Aironet are using their own MAC controller. The 4500 offer standard 1
and 2&nbsp;Mb/s bit rate. The MAC includes all the standard 802.11
features, with Power Saving, WEP, Ad-Hoc mode and roaming, plus a lot
of Aironet extensions (short headers, variable base rate...). Conform
to their reputation, their MAC is one of the richest in term of
features, and one of the most performant.
<p>
The <B>3500</B> family (Frequency Hopping) eventually died, and I
won't talk about it here.
<p>
The 4500 family was quickly followed by the <B>4800</B> family, still
based on the Prism chipset, adding 5.5 and 11&nbsp;Mb/s bit rate,
either in MBOK (proprietary) or CCK, which is 802.11-b compliant. The
4800 can do encryption only at 1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s (this limitation was
removed in the 4800B).
<p>
With introduction of the <B>PrismII</B> chipset, Aironet did release
the <B>4800B</B> family. It is functionally equivalent to the 4800,
except that the new PrismII chipset allows lower price, greater
sensitivity but force a lower transmit power (30 mW). Aironet still
use their own MAC controller in the 4800B (and not the new PrismII MAC
- see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>).
<p>
After the acquisition by Cisco, the Aironet 4800B was renamed <B>Cisco
340</B> series (exact same hardware, new name). Dell also sell the
same hardware under its own brand as <B>Dell TrueMobile 1100</B> (on
the other hand, the TrueMobile 1150 is a Wavelan IEEE).
<p>
Like Lucent, Cisco offer different cards with different level of
encryption. The cards labelled <B>340</B> feature no encryption, the
cards labelled <B>341</B> feature 40 bits encryption and the cards
labelled <B>342</B> feature 128 bits encryption. Moreover, some
versions of the Pcmcia card are sold with antenna but others without
antennas.
<p>
Cisco has now released the <B>Cisco 350</B>, a new family of 802.11b
cards. From the information I did gather, it seems to be equivalent to
the 340 series with a greater transmit power (100&nbsp;mW instead of
30&nbsp;mW). The Cisco 350 also improves the performance of the AP and
introduce greater security (Radius authentication and co).
<p>
Cisco has also released a <B>Mini-PCI (MPI)</B> version of the Aironet
350, to be added in laptops that support a Mini-PCI slot. For some
strange reason, this hardware is slightly different from the regular
Aironet 350 PCI.
<p>
Cisco has also a wide range of <B>IEEE 802.11g</B> products, those are
completely different from this hardware, and most often they are
Atheros cards (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#AtherosMADWiFi"><I>section
4.2</I></A>).

<H3>3.14.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Ben</I> has produced a solid driver for the Aironet card, The
driver supports the ISA, PCI and Pcmcia cards (both 4500, 4800 & 4800B
versions), it looks fairly complete and debugged, with a nice /proc
interface. The driver also has very complete WEP support.
<p>
<I>Ben</I> also told me that the driver was able to recognise the
PC3500 cards, but more work would be needed there to get it fully
working.
<p>
Recently, I've started adding Wireless Extension to this
driver. <I>Ben</I> was kind enough to integrate properly my work in
his driver. Then, <I>Javier Achirica</I> did an amazing job of
completing Wireless Extension support (power management, spy and co),
and this driver has one of the most complete Wireless Extension
support of all.
<p>
Then, <I>Javier</I> added to the driver the Cisco proprietary
API, which allow communication with Cisco utilities (see <A
HREF="#ArlanCisco"><I>section 3.16</I></A>) and, amongst other things,
flashing new firmware on the card. All this amazing work is in the
latest release from <I>Ben</I> (1.5). He also wrote a couple of open
source utilities allowing to dump all the register of the card and to
flash new firmwares through this API.
<p>
Later, the driver has been integrated in the Linux kernel (2.4.6 and
later) and moved to SourceForge. <I>Javier</I> has also added the
ability to dump raw 802.11 frames. Then <I>Javier</I> did extensive
work to fix locking (SMP support), add monitor mode and Wireless
Scanning support (in version 1.4).
<p>
<I>Ben</I> attempted to add support to MPI card and added code for
those cards in the CVS. The work on MPI card was completed and now MPI
cards are properly supported.
<p>
<I>Ben</I> and <I>Javier</I> are no longer active. <I>Dan</I> has
fixed various bug and kept the driver up to date in the kernel, and
<I>Matthieu</I> has added WPA support.

<H3>3.15.1	 The device</H3>

This is the same device as the previous entry (<A
HREF="#Arlan802"><I>section 3.14</I></A>).

<H3>3.15.2	 The driver</H3>

To some, it may seem that this is a totally new driver that has just
popped up in the kernel with little warning. In fact, <I>Elmer</I> had
developed this driver for a commercial company (SpectrumWireless) a
while back and they agreed to let him release it in GPL form after
some month.
<p>
The code is very complete, especially the /proc interface. It comes as
four modules, the generic core, the /proc interface, the PCI/ISA
interface and the Pcmcia interface. The driver support both the 4500
and 4800 families. Unfortunately, the Pcmcia interface is incompatible
with the Linux Pcmcia support and doesn't work well.
<p>
<I>Elmer</I> told me that compared to Ben driver, his driver was
probably more robust and featured but much less friendly. In essence,
the focus was slightly different, so each driver has it own strength.
<p>
This driver was <B>removed</B> from the Linux kernel during 2.5.X, so
it is no longer available in kernel 2.6.X.

<H3>3.16.1	 The device</H3>

This is the same device as the two previous entries (<A
HREF="#Arlan802"><I>section 3.14</I></A>).

<H3>3.16.2	 The driver</H3>

Recently, <I>Cisco</I> decided to get more involved with supporting
their Wireless LAN cards under Linux. Rather than developing an
entirely new driver, they decided to base their work on <I>Ben</I>'s
driver (<A HREF="#Arlan802"><I>section 3.14</I></A>), which is a good
idea. One of the key person behind this operation was <I>Jim
Veneskey</I>.
<p>
The main contribution of <I>Cisco</I> is a proprietary API, which
allow communication with Cisco utilities and, amongst other things,
flashing new firmware on the card, and of course a set of utilities
which are mostly identical to the Windows utilities. They also
provided nice installation scripts and did lot's of testing of the
driver to guarantee its stability (<I>Cisco</I> usually do some pretty
intensive testing of their products).
<p>
However, even if <I>Cisco</I> regularly synchronise with <I>Ben</I>'s
driver (<A HREF="#Arlan802"><I>section 3.14</I></A>), this one
continues to improve. As they are derived from the same base, it's
easy to compare the two drivers. In term of features, I guess that
<I>Ben</I>'s driver is winning, because it now has the Cisco API of
this driver and more complete Wireless Extensions support. However, I
believe that <I>Cisco</I> has an edge in term of stability.
<p>
I hope that the two drivers will merge rather than diverge, and that
changes will be propagated from one to the other, so that we have a
driver with both features and rock solid stability, but only time will
tell... <I>Cisco</I> told me that they were going to try to catch up
with <I>Ben</I>'s driver.
<p>
Note that <I>Cisco</I> changed their web site and their driver is no
longer available as a public download. I can not check if the driver
still exist and what changed has been made to it.

<H3>3.17.1	 The device</H3>

No Wires Needed is a small company in the Netherlands building a range
of 802.11 DS devices, including a Pcmcia card (Swallow), an Access
Point and a Hub. They also offer a ISA version using a ISA to Pcmcia
bridge. They have two version, the <B>550</B> (5.5&nbsp;Mb/s) and the
more recent <B>1100</B> (11&nbsp;Mb/s). BreezeCom also EOM this card
for their DS.11 range (the <B>PC-DS.11</B>).
<p>
The Swallow delivers all the features expected from a 802.11 compliant
device, with ad-hoc networking, authentication and roaming. The main
difference with other 802.11 devices is that NWN offers some strong
link layer encryption and a key management and distribution system.
<p>
The modem is the famous Prism chipset used in many other cards (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.html#Prism"><I>section 2.4</I></A>),
which is 2.4 GHz Direct Sequence, with 1&nbsp;Mb/s, 2&nbsp;Mb/s,
5.5&nbsp;Mb/s and 11&nbsp;Mb/s bit rate. No Wires Needed use their own
MAC design on an embedded ARM processor, and not the AMD or PrismII
MAC controller. This give them more performance and flexibility. Now
that Intersil has acquired No Wires Needed, Intersil can offer 2
different 802.11 MAC controller&nbsp;!

<H3>3.17.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Bas</I> has implemented a quite complete driver for the Swallow 550
and 1100 card (Pcmcia). He has patiently debugged the driver to fix
races, timeouts and increase the performance. The driver is working
for both the NWN and the BreezeCom cards.
<p>
<I>Bas</I> has also implemented Wireless Extension support for the
security support, and support the full range of security features in
the driver. You can also configure the ESSID on the fly with Wireless
Extensions...
<p>
Lately, <I>Bas</I> has been doing lot of work on roaming support. The
driver export the roaming tables in a /proc interface, allowing the
implementation of a user space roaming daemon. This interface also
contains some other configuration parameters.

<H3>3.18.1	 The device</H3>

Recently, No Wires Needed has replaced the Swallow 550 and 1100 with a
new 802.11-b card, the <B>1148</B>. The design and the feature of this
card seems very similar to their previous one (see <A
HREF="#Swallow"><I>section 3.17</I></A>)&nbsp;: The MAC is the same ARM
core and they still offer AirLock encryption. The main difference
seems that they are now using a PrismII modem (see <A
HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>).
<p>
3Com has also released a quite rare <B>old Wireless LAN XJack</B> card
(3CRWE62092A) which is a clone of the NWN 1148 (this card). On the
other hand, the newly released <B>OfficeConnect</B> Wireless LAN cards
(3CRSHPW196/696 - with or without the XJack antenna) and <B>new
Wireless LAN XJack</B> card (3CRWE62092B) are <I>Atmel</I> cards (see
<A HREF="#Atmel"><I>section 3.20</I></A>). The even newer
<B>OfficeConnect CardBus</B> card (3CRSHPW796) is an <I>ADMTek</I>
card (see <A HREF="#ADMtek"><I>section 3.23</I></A>). The older
<B>AirConnect Pcmcia</B> cards (3CRW737A/B) are clone of the <I>Symbol
HR</I> cards (see <A HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 3.10</I></A>), and
the <B>AirConnect PCI</B> card (3CRW777A) is a <I>PrismII PLX</I> card
(see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>). The <B>OfficeConnect
11g</B> card (3CRWE154G72) is an <I>Intersil PrismGT</I> card (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#Prism54"><I>section
4.3</I></A>), and the <B>11a/b/g</B> cards (3CRPAG175/3CRDAG675) are
<I>Atheros</I> cards (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#AtherosMADWiFi"><I>section
4.2</I></A>).
<p>
Coming back to the NWN 1148, the main difference between the 3Com
3CRWE62092A and NWN 1148 cards is the removal of AirLock encryption
(WEP is still available), the addition of Ad-Hoc mode, and of course
the famous pop-up antenna&nbsp;;-)

<H3>3.18.2	 The driver</H3>

Because the card is so similar to the Swallow, it was natural that a
driver for this card would be derived from the Swallow driver. In
fact, No Wires Needed contacted <I>Bas</I> to implement a driver for
the new card. <I>Bas</I> modified his Swallow driver and created this
driver which offer very similar functionality and feature as the
Swallow driver (see <A HREF="#Swallow"><I>section 3.17</I></A>).
<p>
So, the driver includes complete security support, Wireless Extensions
and roaming support. The driver also include read only support for
most low level commands (SNWNMP).
<p>
<I>Bas</I> has also added in the driver the necessary support for the
3Com WLAN XJack cards, including its specific features. All features
of the card (ad-hoc mode, encryption) are configurable through
Wireless Extensions.

<H3>3.19.1	 The device</H3>

In the past years, Nokia has slowly moved into the Wireless LAN
market. They started by buying <I>Intalk</I>, a company producing
PrismI clones (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.html#Prism"><I>section 2.4</I></A>), and
Nokia continued selling those cards, renamed Nokia <B>C020</B> and
<B>C021</B>. While being busy working on BlueTooth and HiperLanII,
Nokia didn't forget 802.11-b and released a new set of card, the
<B>C110</B> and <B>C111</B>.
<p>
As can be expected, the Nokia C110/C111 is another PrismII clone (see
<A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>). On the other hand, it seem
that Nokia has changed quite a few things compared to the original
PrismII design, for example they have added a Smart Card reader on the
Pcmcia card (for security settings).

<H3>3.19.2 The driver</H3>

<I>Nokia</I> initially quietly made this driver available in the
registered only part of their web site and didn't mention it anywhere,
fortunately I have my spies to inform me&nbsp;;-). Later on, they
moved this driver to their official driver page on their public web
site. This driver is only for the C110/C111, on the other hand the
C020 is supposed to work with the linux-wlan package (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.html#Prism"><I>section 2.4</I></A>).
<p>
The driver contains a very thin source wrapper on top of the binary
part (one version for kernel 2.2.X, one for 2.4.X). On the other hand,
the package come with exhaustive set of complex Pcmcia scripts to
configure the card and enable profiles.
<p>
The driver works in infrastructure and Ad-Hoc mode, and support WEP.

<H3>3.20.1	 The device</H3>

Atmel has decided to join the selected club of company selling 802.11b
chipsets. Their design is based on an ARM7 processor, and offer a
Pcmcia and a USB version. The USB version is by far the most popular,
because it was first to market. Various 802.11b radios can be used
with this chipset (such as the PrismII radio). Very little public
information is available about those products, but as they are 802.11
compliant we can expect the usual set of features.
<p>
Of course, with any USB cards the main issue is performance. The
streaming abstraction of USB doesn't work well with register/memory
based chipset designs and slow down operations. Also, USB add a
noticeable latency. I currently don't have any data on how well those
cards performs in the respect.
<p>
Linksys and D-Link are selling various USB products based on this
chipset, such as Gemtek <B>WL-280</B>, D-Link <B>DWL-120</B>, Linksys
<B>WUSB11</B>... It seems that the SMC <B>2632W</B> is a Pcmcia card
also based on the Atmel chipset.
<p>
The newly released <B>3Com OfficeConnect</B> Wireless LAN cards
(3CRSHPW196/696 - with or without the XJack antenna) and new <B>3Com
Wireless LAN XJack</B> (3CRWE62092B) are also Atmel Pcmcia cards.

<H3>3.20.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Atmel</I> decided to release themselves a Linux driver. This driver
is in fact a set of driver for the different combination of
controllers and radios, and was initially based on a binary
library. However, <I>Atmel</I> changed their mind and eventually
released the driver as full source GPL. The USB versions work with
both uhci and ohci USB drivers. The driver support WEP and Ad-Hoc
mode.
<p>
The package from <I>Atmel</I> include specific configuration tools
(command line and X-Window). Just after the driver was GPL'ed, the
support for Wireless Extensions was fixed and greatly enhanced by
<I>Ron</I> (Wireless Tools can now be used to configure the
card). Lately, <I>Atmel</I> has improved and enhanced the USB driver,
but also removed support for Intersil radio, so you will need to use
older version of the driver for products using Intersil radio. On the
other hand, the Pcmcia driver seems to be still based on an older
version of the code.
<p>
Lately, the driver has gained support for kernel 2.6.X, better support
for Wireless Extensions and support for WPA.

This is the same device as the previous entry (<A
HREF="#Atmel"><I>section 3.20</I></A>).

<H3>3.21.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Oliver</I> and a group of people were not happy about the official
Atmel driver and its development (<A HREF="#Atmel"><I>section
3.20</I></A>), and therefore he started to write an alternate driver
from scratch, based on the information available in the official
driver, and soon those other people started to help him.
<p>
The driver support only USB devices, and it support both Intersil and
RFMD radios. At this time, the new driver is still in development, and
therefore still has some limitations, but it already support both
infrastructure and ad-hoc mode, and has some Wireless Extension
support.
<p>
As <I>Olivier</I> was no longer active, <I>J&ouml;rg</I> took over the
driver and is now fixing many bugs, making it more robust and adding a
few missing features. For example, version 0.12 adds Wireless Scanning
support, and is the last version to support kernel 2.4.X.
<p>
When <I>J&ouml;rg</I> became inactive, <I>Guido</I> and <I>Pavel</I>
took over the driver. Most of their work in subsequent releases (0.13
to 0.16) was all the driver cleanup necessary to be able to integrate
the driver in the kernel (this integration has not happened yet).

<I>Simon</I> also was not happy with the original Atmel driver. He
decided to rewrite the Pcmcia/PCI driver based on the original code,
with the main target being integration in <B>kernel 2.6.X</B>, which
was done on 2.6.5. <I>Simon</I> did an extensive amount of work on the
driver, for example his driver has very complete Wireless Extension
support including Wireless Scanning. However, this driver is not
compliant with kernel 2.4.X and earlier.
<p>
This driver was mostly tested with Pcmcia cards, however <I>Simon</I>
also managed to get a PCI card for testing and added PCI support in
the driver. Some of those cards don't have firmwares and therefore
need to use the new <B>firmware uploading</B> facility of Linux (via
HotPlug).

<H3>3.23.1	 The device</H3>

ADMtek is a small taiwanese company that designed a single chip
802.11b MAC solution. Very little is known about it (for example which
radio is used with the MAC), but we can expect compliance with the
802.11b specification and the usual feature set. One of the main
feature of this chipset is that is uses a PCI busmaster interface (as
opposed to the Intersil PrismII that uses ISA PIO - <A
HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>), which result in much lower CPU
utilisation (and potentially higher performance).
<p>
Most <B>Cardbus 802.11b</B> cards are based on this chipset. The
chipset is starting to appear in products, such as some D-Link 802.11b
Cardbus and PCI cards, Belkin PCI cards, the SMC 2602W V2 and the 3Com
3CRSHPW796.
<p>
ADMtek was bought by Infineon in 2004. Since then, their web site
disappeared, and the Infineon web site has no information on their
wireless LAN products. They seem to have shifted their focus towards
`system on a chip' and don't seem to make standalone 802.11 modules
anymore.

<H3>3.23.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>ADMtek</I> has released a Linux driver based on a binary library,
that can be compile for different distributions. The driver has
complete support for Wireless Extensions, and many people have
reported success using it.
<p>
<I>Eduardo</I> made a patch to add support for the 3Com 3CRSHPW796 to
this driver.

main difference with ADMtek driver is that this driver is fully
OpenSource and support only kernel 2.6.X.
<p>
The driver is still young, but its gaining feature and stability with
each release, and is well written. Recently it has gained support for
monitor and Ad-Hoc mode, and many bugfixes and cleanups. You should
contact <I>Michael</I> if you want to help.
<p>
The initial version of the driver uses standalone 802.11
code. <I>Michael</I> is porting the driver to the new <B>mac80211</B>
kernel stack (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#Centrino3945mac80211"><I>section
4.9</I></A>). This alternate version is only available in the

<H3>3.25.1	 The device</H3>

Realtek is a taiwanese company known for its Ethernet cards, which has
recently released a 802.11 chipset. This chip seems to have all the
usual 802.11 features, and offer only a PCI/CardBus interface (for
lower CPU utilisation).

<H3>3.25.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Realtek</I> has released a binary driver for their device, with
precompiled version for Red-Hat and SuSE. The driver doesn't use
Wireless Extension (but some private extensions), and has a strange
setup procedure (manual enable, require proper commands in the proper
sequence).
<p>
I didn't try this driver, but I got some feedback from many users. The
driver version before 1.2 were difficult to install and prone to crash
the kernel. The version 1.2 had many troubles (such as reassociation),
but was working. Version 1.3 is more stable, but a little too
talkative.
<p>
Version 1.4 of the driver also adds support for making the card an
Access Point. Version 1.5 supports newer version of gcc and newer kernels.

<H3>3.26.1	 The device</H3>

This is the same device as the previous entry (<A
HREF="#Realtek"><I>section 3.25</I></A>).

<H3>3.26.2	 The driver</H3>

The <I>Realtek</I> driver is not the most user friendly, and many
people can't manage to make it work on their configuration. This lead
<I>Andrea</I> to write his own driver for the Realtek chipset. After
much hard work by <I>Andrea</I>, his driver is now functional, and
evolving quickly.
<p>
This driver is fully OpenSource and the source is much closer to the
standard of other Linux drivers. It support PCI and Pcmcia card with
the Philips radio (the most common), and has experimental support for
the Maxim radio. It reuses the WEP implementation of the Centrino
driver (<A HREF="#Centrino"><I>section 3.28</I></A>), which is well
tested and featured. It supports the latest kernel 2.6.X and 2.4.X,
has complete support for Wireless Extensions, and support monitor
mode, so you can see how much <I>Andrea</I> has been busy lately...
<p>
During early 2005, <I>Andrea</I> decided to reorganise the driver, and
created a new branch of the driver called
<B>rtl818x-newstack</B>. This branch is based on the <B>Intel
ieee80211 stack</B> from the Centrino driver (see <A
HREF="#Centrino"><I>section 3.28</I></A>). The goal of this branch is
better integration in the kernel, and also support for the newer
Realtek 802.11g cards (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#RealTek80211g"><I>section
4.16</I></A>). It seems that <I>Realtek</I> is also taking a more
active role in supporting <I>Andrea</I> and this driver.
<p>
Mid 2005, <I>Andrea</I> stopped updating his project, leaving his work
on the new branch unfinished. Beginning 2007, a group of users lead by
<I>Hauke</I> restarted working on the driver, with a new project page
and new repository. Their main work so far has been updating the
driver to work with the latest kernel.

<H3>3.27.1	 The device</H3>

Ralink is yet another taiwanese company having recently released a
802.11b chipset. This chip seems to have all the usual 802.11b
features, and offer only a PCI/CardBus interface (for lower CPU
utilisation).

<H3>3.27.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Ralink</I> created the original Linux driver for this card, and
<I>Minitar</I> released it as fully OpenSource and started helping
driver users on their forums. This driver support the Wireless
Extensions, and also comes with a dedicated graphical
utility. <I>Flavio</I> created a Debian package for this driver, and
documented how to install and use this driver.
<p>
Then, <I>Mark</I> created a SourceForge project for the driver and
started to maintain it, helped by many users of the driver. Many
patches have been integrated to improve the stability and
functionality of the driver.
<p>
<I>Ivo</I> has started a rewrite of the driver, called <B>rt2x00</B>,
his goal is to have a source code easier to integrate in the Linux
kernel and to maintain. His rewrite targets both the RT2400 and the
new RT2500 (<A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#Ralink2500"><I>section
4.11</I></A>). The initial version of this new driver was using the
the <B>Intel ieee80211 stack</B> from the Centrino driver (see <A
HREF="#Centrino"><I>section 3.28</I></A>).
<p>
Then, <I>Ivo</I> ported the rt2x00 driver to the new <B>mac80211</B>
stack (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#Centrino3945mac80211"><I>section
4.9</I></A>), and lots of development has happened on that version of
the driver. This alternate version is available in the wireless-dev
GIT repository and in the CVS, and should appear in a Linux kernel in
the future.

<H3>3.28.1	 The device</H3>

The Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 is the second generation wireless LAN
product from Intel. Intel initially sold various wireless LAN cards
and Access Points from Symbol as Intel <B>PRO/Wireless 2011</B> (<A
HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 3.10</I></A>). However, Intel has a
long experience with Ethernet MAC controllers, so it was natural for
them to create their own wireless LAN chips. The first MAC controller
created by Intel is the PRO/Wireless 2100, and we can expect many more
products to come.
<p>
The <B>PRO/Wireless 2100</B> MAC controller is fully IEEE 802.11b
compliant and has all the usual 802.11b features. It's a PCI Busmaster
design, for low CPU utilisation. The Radio most likely is done in
collaboration with Symbol (Intel and Symbol have one of those
strategical alliances).
<p>
The main difference between this chipset and the vast number of other
802.11b chipset is Intel's marketing. The PRO/Wireless 2100 is not
sold as a standalone product, but only as part of the <B>Centrino</B>
package. Centrino is just a marketing exercise, only laptops equipped
with a Intel processor, an Intel chipset and a Intel PRO/Wireless card
can carry the Centrino logo. The PRO/Wireless 2100 is a regular
MiniPCI card (it's not integrated on the motherboard as some rumors
suggests), and you can replace the PRO/Wireless 2100 of Centrino
laptops by any other MiniPCI wireless LAN of your choice.
<p>
Intel has been quite successful, and a large number of recent laptops
includes a PRO/Wireless 2100 MiniPCI card. In fact, if you buy a
<B>laptop with integrated 802.11b</B> support (without 802.11g or
802.11a support), it most likely has a PRO/Wireless 2100 card. On the
other hand, the PRO/Wireless 2100 is not available as a separate
Pcmcia, Cardbus, PCI or USB card.

<H3>3.28.2	 The driver</H3>

The Linux driver for the PRO/Wireless 2100 was released a long time
after the card themselves. For this reason, Intel did receive a lot of
harsh criticism from people buying laptops with this card and finding
that there was no driver or documentation for it. This was a bit
unfair, as Intel has always been supportive of Linux, for example most
drivers for Intel Ethernet chipset are directly maintained by Intel,
and producing good driver takes time. Eventually, Intel released a
fully Open Source driver, which they support directly.
<p>
By the time <I>James</I> released the driver, it was already
functional, but limited. Since them, many people have contributed
fixes and enhancements, and development is happening quickly. Wireless
Scanning was added. WEP support was added by borrowing code from
HostAP. The driver require firmware loading, and the firmware loading
procedure was converted to use the standard HotPlug firmware loading
support. Support is also being added for the wireless on/off button of
many specific laptops.
<p>
The Linux driver require a <B>specific firmware</B> which Intel says
is identical to the Windows firmware but packaged differently. This
firmware mostly make sure that Linux users don't do things breaking
various radio regulations. Intel must be applauded for taking the
effort of releasing this specific Linux firmware (and their updates),
this is what enables the driver to be fully OpenSource and forced
other driver to be binary, such as the Atheros driver (<A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#AtherosMADWiFi"><I>section
4.2</I></A>).
<p>
<I>James</I> and various other contributors have been very hard at
work on the driver and many bugs have been fixed. After that, most of
the work has been in the area of ad-hoc and monitor mode, WPA support
and power management.
<p>
Around summer 2005, <I>James</I> decided to spin-off the code he had
borrowed from the HostAP driver in a separate <B>Intel ieee80211
stack</B>, shared by all Intel drivers (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#Centrino2200"><I>section
4.6</I></A> and <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#Centrino3945i"><I>section
4.8</I></A>). The Intel ieee80211 stack was included in <B>kernel
2.6.14</B>, alongside this driver, and has seen continuous
improvements after this. This stack only handles 802.11 framing and
802.11 encryption, but not the SoftMAC function (802.11 management),
as those drivers don't require it. A separate SoftMAC layer was
created for this stack (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#Broadcom"><I>section
4.13</I></A>), but none of the Intel driver uses it.

<H3>3.29.2	 The driver</H3>

Originally <I>Sweex</I> distributed a Linux driver for their ZyDAS
based USB dongles, but suddenly they retired their Linux drivers from
their support site. This driver was based on the linux-wlan-ng driver
(see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 3.6</I></A>). The driver was then
improved by the Linux users.
<p>
<I>Jeroen</I> rewrote the driver to get rid of its dependency on
linux-wlan-ng, and created a much smaller and simpler driver. This
driver was further improved and included in kernel 2.6.12. Despite its
very small size, the driver support a large number of features, such
as Wireless Extensions, Scanning and Monitor mode.

<H3>3.30.1	 The device</H3>

SiS is a taiwanese company better known for their CPU chipsets, but
they do other products, and amongst them 802.11b chips. The SiS 160
was their first product, offers all the standard 802.11 features and
has a PCI interface. The SiS 162 is their second product, adds WPA
support and has both a PCI and a USB interface. Those chips are low
cost, and are typically found in cheap USB dongles.

<H3>3.20.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>SiS</I> released two drivers, a driver for the SiS 160 and another
driver for the SiS 162. Those driver are based on a large binary part
and a very small source wrapper, and are designed for kernel 2.4.X
(and only on x86 platforms). They also contains their own binary
configuration tool, and some basic support for Wireless Extensions.
<p>
Users reports are that these drivers can be problematic and only work
for kernel 2.4.0 to 2.4.18, and do not work in any 2.6.X kernel. From
a quick look at the source code, most of the functionality is in the
binary part and it might not be possible to port it to more recent
kernels.
