<H2>Presentation</H2>
</A>

The Linux Wireless Extension and the Wireless Tools are an <B>Open
Source project</B> sponsored by <A
HREF="http://www.hpl.hp.com">Hewlett Packard</A> (through my
contribution) since 1996, and build with the <B>contribution of many
Linux users</B> all over the world.
<p>
The <B>Wireless Extension (WE)</B> is a generic API allowing a driver
to expose to the user space configuration and statistics specific to
common Wireless LANs. The beauty of it is that a single set of tool
can support all the variations of Wireless LANs, regardless of their
type (as long as the driver support Wireless Extension). Another
advantage is these parameters may be changed on the fly without
restarting the driver (or Linux).
<p>
The <B>Wireless Tools (WT)</B> is a set of tools allowing to
manipulate the Wireless Extensions. They use a textual interface and
are rather crude, but aim to support the full Wireless
Extension. There are <I><A HREF="#links">many other tools</A></I> you
can use with Wireless Extensions, however Wireless Tools is the
reference implementation.

<UL>
<LI><B>iwconfig</B> manipulate the basic wireless parameters
<LI><B>iwlist</B> allow to initiate scanning and list frequencies,
bit-rates, encryption keys...
<LI><B>iwspy</B> allow to get per node link quality
<LI><B>iwpriv</B> allow to manipulate the Wireless Extensions specific
to a driver (private)
<LI><B>ifrename</B> allow to name interfaces based on various static criteria
</UL>

<p>
Most <B>Linux distributions</B> also have <A
HREF="DISTRIBUTIONS.txt">integrated Wireless Extensions support</A> in
their networking initialisation scripts, for easier <B>boot-time</B>
configuration of wireless interfaces. They also include Wireless Tools
as part of their standard packages.
<p>
Wireless configuration can also be done <A
HREF="HOTPLUG-UDEV.txt">using the Hotplug or uDev scripts</A> and
distribution specific support, this enable the proper support of any
<B>removable wireless interface</B> (Pcmcia, CardBus, USB...).
<p>
Any versions of the <A HREF="http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/">Pcmcia
package</A> offer the possibility to do wireless configuration of
Pcmcia and Cardbus card through the<A HREF="PCMCIA.txt">file
wireless.opts</A>. This allow to fully integrate wireless settings in
the Pcmcia scheme mechansism. However, this method is now deprecated
in favor of distribution specific methods.
<p>
Please note that the Wireless Tools (starting with version 19)
supports fully <B>IEEE 802.11</B> parameters and devices, support
older style of devices and most proprietary protocols, and are
prepared to handle HiperLan as well. More recent versions of course
adds <B>more 802.11 support</B>.
<br>
But, unfortunately not all <I><A HREF="#drivers">drivers</A></I>
support all these features...

<p>
<HR width=25%>

<A NAME="docu">
<H2>Documentation & errata</H2>
</A>

The Wireless Tools package include extensive <B>man pages</B> for each
of the tools, which are the most up to date and most detailed
documentation on the capability of these tools.
<p>
The Wireless Tools package also includes two text documents on the
usage of Wireless Tools to configure wireless cards
automatically&nbsp;:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="DISTRIBUTIONS.txt">DISTRIBUTIONS.txt</A> describes how
various <B>Linux distributions</B> implement Wireless Extensions in
their specific <B>configuration scripts</B>. Please read this, as most
distributions <I>no longer use wireless.opts</I>. I need your help
making this document better.

<LI><A HREF="HOTPLUG-UDEV.txt">HOTPLUG-UDEV.txt</A> describes how to
manage wireless interfaces using the <B>HotPlug subsystem</B> and the
distribution specific support for wireless, and includes some more
advanced material. This is a complement to <A
HREF="DISTRIBUTIONS.txt">DISTRIBUTIONS.txt</A>.

<LI><A HREF="PCMCIA.txt">PCMCIA.txt</A> describes the use of <B>Pcmcia
schemes and wireless.opts</B> (i.e. configuration with the default
Pcmcia scripts). This method is deprecated, but still work and has
some advantages.
</UL>

<p>
Some <B>driver documentations</B> (man page, web, README) describe
what the driver support in term of Wireless Extension and how the
various Wireless Extension parameters map to the capability of the
card.
<p>
The <A HREF="Wireless.html">Linux Wireless LAN Howto</A> contains a
section about the <A HREF="Linux.Wireless.Extensions.html">Wireless
Extensions</A>, but it's a bit out of date for the details...
<p>

<HR width=25%>

<p>
I have also the following errata and comments :

<UL>

<LI>In the rare cases where your kernel isn't compiled with Wireless
Extensions (/proc/net/wireless non-existent), you need to recompile
it with Wireless Extensions (<B>CONFIG_NET_RADIO</B> enabled).

<LI>After recompiling a kernel with Wireless Extension, you have to
recompile your driver or the Pcmcia package as well (and restart it).

<LI>All versions of Wireless Tools up to version <B>26</B> need to be
<B>compiled</B> for the precise version of Wireless Extension present
on the system. Starting with Wireless Tools <B>27</B>, Wireless Tools
can handle <B>multiple versions of Wireless Extension</B> without
recompile.

<LI>The Wireless Extensions and Wireless Tools <B>version numbers will
not match</B> with each other. The Wireless Tools and the Wireless
Extensions (the underlying API) evolve independantly of each
other. The command <I>iwconfig --version</I> gives you the detail of
your setup.

<LI>Compilation of the Wireless Tools used to be tricky, especially in
the header area. I believe this has been fixed for good.

<LI>For kernels <B>before 2.2.14/2.3.30</B>, use Wireless Tools version
<B>19</B>.

<LI>For kernel <B>after 2.2.14/2.3.30</B> use Wireless Tools version
<B>20</B> or greater.

<LI>For kernel <B>after 2.6.13</B> use Wireless Tools version
<B>27</B> or greater.

<LI>The tools and the wireless library are <B>GPL</B>.

<LI>In the old time, you could upgrade Wireless Extensions by just
changing <U>wireless.h</U>. Starting with <B>Wireless Extensions
v12</B>, this is no longer true, you need to apply the full patch to
the kernel. See below for the patches.

<LI>Further down, you will find a <I><A HREF="#debug">FAQ about common
problems</A></I>.

<LI>Recompile and reinstall this kernel.
<LI>Recompile and reinstall the kernel modules.
<LI>Do <I>cat /proc/net/wireless</I>. If the command returns an error,
you are using the wrong kernel. Try again.
<LI>If you are using driver from the external Pcmcia package (kernel
2.2 and earlier), go into the Pcmcia package, do a <I>make config</I>
<LI>Check that the following line appears : "<B>Radio network interface
support is enabled.</B>".
<LI>Recompile and install the Pcmcia package.
</OL>

<LI><B><I>iwconfig</I> still says "no wireless extensions.", displays
garbage or crashes before displaying anything.</B>
<OL type=1>
<LI>Make sure you have fully checked <B>all</B> the steps of the second
question.
<LI>The driver or driver version you are using probably does not
support Wireless Extension.
<LI>Check status of Wireless Extension support for your driver in the
<A HREF="Wireless.html#howto">Wireless LAN Howto</A>.
<LI>If your driver is listed, try a more recent version.
<LI>If your hardware is listed, try the driver mentionned (there may
be multiple of them).
<LI>Make sure that Pcmcia is loading the driver you think it is
loading. Hack the various files in <U>/etc/pcmcia/</U> until it loads
the correct driver (<I>grep</I> is your friend).
<LI>If you still can't get it, or if you find no suitable driver,
complain to the driver maintainer.
</OL>

<LI><B>I try to change a specific parameter with <I>iwconfig</I>, it

A few bits of history for your amusement...

<p>
The oldest version of <B>wireless tools</B> that was made is v10, its

<p>

The core API is strongly versioned, so that application can detect
changes in the API. The <B>version number</B> of Wireless Extensions
specify which feature are available through the API, and is completely
independant of the version of the tool using it, for example, each
version of the Wireless Tools can support a wide range Wireless
Extension versions. You can use <B>iwconfig --version</B> to get all
the details on your current setup.
<p>
One common issue is that Wireless Extensions offers only source level
backward/forward compatibility, not binary compatibility. Therefore,
every time the core API is updated or changed on the system (kernel
upgrade), both drivers and tools need to be <B>recompiled</B>. Version
27 and later of Wireless Tools can support multiple versions of
Wireless Extensions without the need of a recompile.
<p>
Some wireless drivers require a minimum level of Wireless Extensions,
and most often newer version of Wireless Extensions enable additional
features in the driver. Usually, the simplest way to upgrade the
Wireless Extensions is to <B>upgrade your kernel</B> (see table
above).  Most driver support the newer Wireless Extension only in
their most recent version, so most often to get the benefit of the
additional features you might need to <B>upgrade your
driver</B>.
<p>
Alternatively, you can use the patches below. Those patches may not
always apply properly to your kernel, they may crash or eat your hard
drive, use at your own risks and don't expect much help, because I
would rather have you upgrading your kernel. When upgrading from over
version of Wireless Extensions to another, you need to apply all the
patches for the versions in between in the proper order, otherwise the
patches will reject. After patching the kernel, don't forget to
recompile and reinstall the kernel itself, the kernel modules, the
Pcmcia package modules and the various external driver modules.

<LI>The <A HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11b.html#Arlan802">Aironet
driver</A> (version 1.4 and later from Ben) is an alternate reference
implementation of Wireless Extensions for 802.11b devices. It

different than HostAP.

<LI>The <A HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11b.html#Orinoco">Orinoco
MPL/GPL driver</A> version v0.14 or later is also an alternate
reference implementation of Wireless Extensions for 802.11b

driver tend to be easier to study than both the HostAP and the Aironet
drivers.
