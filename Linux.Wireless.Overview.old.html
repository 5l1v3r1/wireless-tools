<H2>1	Introduction</H2>
I don't pretend to make a course on <B>Wireless LAN</B>. I guess that
many books explain the subject in more details and accuracy than me
(anyway, I hope). It just seems to me that many users of Wireless LANs
don't really know what is inside their magic piece of kit and are
curious about it. I hope that this document will help them to
understand a bit more the different technological aspects and compare
the different Wireless LANs functionalities.
<p>
I'm not really a professional of radio communications. While working
on the Wavelan driver, I've gathered many information trying to
understand how it was working. The vendors documentation and web sites
were also very helpful, many of them really try to explain the
technologies behind their products and provide <I>white
papers</I>. The Net contains also a lot of papers and reports on the
subject of wireless LANs and radio communications.
<p>
I have still a limited knowledge and understanding of all this, so I
hope that it is mostly accurate, complete and that it will help
you. If some knowledgeable person could help me to improve this
document, or if anybody could give me some suggestions or corrections,
I would be glad...

<H2>2 MAC, LAN, Layer and other strange words...</H2>
<UL>
<LI><B>Bandwidth</B>&nbsp;: commonly it is the size of the channel
used by the radio (the amount of frequency available to the
system). By extension, it can also sometimes refer to the speed of the
system (the bit rate).

<LI><B>Carrier Sense</B>&nbsp;: checking the medium to assess if it is
free or if there is a transmission going on. Usually measure of the
received power.

<LI><B>Cell</B>&nbsp;: radio neighbourhood, area where all nodes can
communicate with each other. As the range over radio is limited, the
network is split into independent cells and a cell to cell
communication is provided (via access point or internal routing).

<LI><B>Channel</B> &nbsp;: On the radio, this is usually synonym of a
specific frequency, and by extension the communication medium.

<LI><B>dB</B> (decibel)&nbsp;: logarithmic way to express a
value. Usually the signal strength (transmitted and received power) is
expressed in dBm (the reference is 1&nbsp;mW - 0&nbsp;dBm). A
difference between two values in dBm is without unit, in dB (in fact,
this is a factor between the two values).

<LI><B>Ethernet</B>&nbsp;: standard wired LAN protocol. Includes
physical and link layers.

<LI><B>Frequency band</B>&nbsp;: portion of the radio spectrum
delimited for a particular use. For example, most wireless LANs use
the 2.4 to 2.48&nbsp;GHz band. A frequency band is usually divided in
channels.

<LI><B>Header</B>&nbsp;: informations added by the protocol in front
of the payload in the packet for its own use (addresses, packet type,
sequence number, CRC...). Each protocol adds a different header, so in
a typical TCP/IP packet we have a MAC header, an IP header and a TCP
header, followed by the payload.

<LI><B>IP</B>&nbsp;: see TCP/IP.

<LI><B>IPX</B>&nbsp;: network protocol used in Netware, usually with SPX.

<LI><B>LAN (Local Area Network)</B>&nbsp;: network on a short
distance, as opposed to WAN (typically inside a building).

<LI><B>Latency</B>&nbsp;: measure of the performance of a network for
short requests and multimedia traffic. There is no real standard
measurement, it might be the time to send and transmit a packet, or
the time spent in the transmit queue, or the time for an answer to
come back, or a number of requests per second...

<LI><B>Layer</B>&nbsp;: this terminology comes from the OSI
specification. It divides any communicating system into 7 layers, each
having a different functionality. Layer 1 is the physical layer, and
layer 2 is the link layer. IP could be assimilated as layer 3 (network
layer), and TCP as layer 4 (transport layer).

<LI><B>Link layer</B>&nbsp;: This is the part of the protocol managing
the direct delivery between two devices on a specific link layer
(coaxial bus, point to point link, radio...). This includes
packetisation and addressing. Most of this is implemented in the MAC.

<LI><B>MAC (Medium Access Control)</B>&nbsp;: this is the part of the
radio device managing the protocol and the usage of the link. It
decides when to transmit and when to receive, creates the packets
headers and filters the received packets.

<LI><B>Medium</B>&nbsp;: name to describe the mean used to transfer
information. This could be a wire (twisted pairs, coax...), an optic
fibber, the radio waves (the air), infrared light...

<LI><B>Modem</B>&nbsp;: in a radio device, this is the part converting
the bits to transmit into a modulation of the radio waves and the
reverse at the reception. It does the analog to digital conversion,
the generation of the frequency, the modulation and the amplification.

<LI><B>Modulation</B>&nbsp;: specific way of coding information on a
radio frequency. Basically, there is amplitude modulation (AM) and
frequency/phase modulation (FM), but there exist many variations and
combinations.

<LI><B>NetBeui</B>&nbsp;: network protocol used in Lan Manager.

<LI><B>Node</B>&nbsp;: a device part of the network, source or
destination of the data. For us, a computer with a radio card in it.

<LI><B>Noise</B>&nbsp;: any unwanted signal. Background noise,
interferences, transmissions from nodes not belonging to the
network...

<LI><B>Packet</B>&nbsp;: Unit of transmission over the network. The
data to be transmitted is split into packets, which are sent
individually over the network.

<LI><B>Protocol</B>&nbsp;: specification of the interactions between
systems and the data manipulated. This describes what to do and when
(the rules), and the format of the data exchanged on the lower
communication layer.

<LI><B>Physical layer</B>&nbsp;: this is the part of the device
interacting with the medium. For a radio LAN, the physical layer is
also called modem.

<LI><B>TCP/IP</B>&nbsp;: network protocol used by Unix and
Internet. Better in some respects than NetBeui and IPX (allows
routing, for example).

<LI><B>SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio)</B>&nbsp;: difference in strength
between the signal we want to receive and the background noise (or any
unwanted signal).

<LI><B>Throughput</B>&nbsp;: measure of the performance of a network
for large data transfer (such as FTP, NFS, HTTP 1.1). This speed is
expressed in bits per seconds or a multiple.

<LI><B>WAN (Wide Area Network)</B>&nbsp;: network on a large
scale&nbsp;: a town, a country or the world. Definitely not a LAN.

<LI><B>Wired</B>&nbsp;: using a wire.

<LI><B>Wireless</B>&nbsp;: not using a wire. For networks, it might be radio or infrared.

</UL>

<H2>3 Anatomy of a radio LAN</H2>
A <B>radio network</B> is a collection of nodes communicating together
through radio devices. It is sometime called a <I>radio Ethernet</I>,
by analogy of the wired technology. Most <B>radio devices</B> are a
card (ISA, Pcmcia) to plug in a PC (or workstation), and interact
directly with the standard networking stack on it (no need of PPP or
any specific protocol stack).
<p>
A radio device is composed of two main parts. The first is the
<B>radio modem</B>. This is the part transmitting (modulating) the
data onto the frequency and receiving other transmissions. It is
composed of <I>antenna(s)</I>, <I>amplificators</I>, <I>frequency
synthesisers</I>, <I>filters</I> and other bits of magic. These are
mainly analog parts, and a bit of digital.
<p>
The modem main characteristics are the <I> frequency band</I> , the
<I>signalling rate</I> , the <I>modulation</I> and the <I>transmitted
power</I> . People building modems are also talking a lot of SNR and
dB...
<p>
The second part of the radio device is the <B>MAC controller</B>,
responsible to run the MAC protocol. This is implemented mainly in an
ASIC or a microcontroler on the card, but some functionalities of the
MAC may be as well in the driver on the PC. The card also includes
some memory for the MAC controller to store incoming and outgoing
packets (buffers) and other data (configuration, statistics).
<p>
The main characteristics of the MAC are the <I>packet format</I>
(size, headers), the <I>channel access mechanisms</I> and the
<I>network management</I> features. The amount of on-board memory is
also important, because the MAC may need a significant number of
buffers to compensate the PC and interface latencies.
<p>
The card <B>interface</B> to the PC through one of its buses (<I>ISA,
PCI, Pcmcia</I>...) or communication ports (<I>serial, parallel,
USB</I> or <I>Ethernet</I>). This interface allows the software to
communicate with the MAC controller and most of the time directly to
the on board memory (the software writes packets to a specific
location of it, then the controller reads them and sends them).
<p>
The main characteristic of the interface is mainly the speed (i/o,
shared memory or DMA). The flexibility and functionality of it are
usually more a concern for the person writing the driver&nbsp;:-)
<p>
With all modern operating systems, the end application doesn't access
directly the hardware but use a standard API. The operating system
needs a <B>driver</B> to interface the hardware to the network stack
(<I>TCP/IP, NetBeui, IPX</I>...). The main function of the driver is
to manage the hardware and to answer its request (to service
interrupts). In most of the Wireless LANs, the driver also implements
some parts of the MAC protocol.
<p>
The main characteristic of the driver is the bugs&nbsp;:-(
<p>
There is also some other technologies (sometimes calling themselves
incorrectly wireless networks) like wireless bridges and cable
replacement, but they are very different from networking. They are
very limited in features (no broadcasting) and only allow a set of
point to point links (so, no native TCP/IP). Those are based mostly on
the same techniques, but with a much more crude MAC protocol (no
multiple access) and interface to the serial link (cable replacement)
or ethernet port (wireless bridges). We restrict ourselves to true
wireless LANs, because what doesn't run natively TCP/IP is not
&quot;fun&quot;&nbsp;:-)

<H2>4 Physical layer</H2>
This section of the document deals with all the issues related to the
physical layer (bottom of the pile, OSI wise&nbsp;:-), or in our case
the radio modem.

<H3>4.1 ISM frequency bands (900&nbsp;MHz &amp; 2.4&nbsp;GHz)</H3>
In every country, the use of the radio spectrum is <B>regulated</B> by
some organisations. This is the <I>FCC</I> for North America and the
<I>ETSI</I> for Europe. These regulators define the allocation of each
radio frequency bandwidth&nbsp;: for TV and radio broadcasting, for
the telecommunication operators, for the army... Usually, to use a
bandwidth, you must negotiate with these bodies, register your
architecture and buy the right to use the frequency.
<p>
These organisations, aware of the prospects of local radio
communications for individual users, have allocated some specific
frequency bands to be used in a more flexible way. The oldest and most
commonly used ones are located at 900&nbsp;MHz and 2.4&nbsp;GHz and
called the <B>ISM bands</B> (<I>Industrial, Scientific</I> and
<I>Medical</I>). The main characteristic of these bands is that they
are <B>unlicensed</B>, this means that the user is free to use them
without having to register or to pay anything (apart from the radio
hardware).
<p>

Of course, to avoid abuses, these organisations have imposed a set of
rules for these bandwidths and only the products conforming to those
rules are allowed to emit in them. These rules specify at least the
maximum power transmitted in the band and the out of band emissions
(to not pollute adjacent bands). The ISM bands rules specify as well
that <B>Spread Spectrum</B> has to be used (either <I>Direct
Sequence</I> or <I>Frequency Hopping</I>, see <A
HREF="#spreadspectrum"><I>Chapter 4.3</I></A>), and how the channels
are defined, to allow the peaceful cohabitation of different systems
(that's the theory).
<p>
These rules may vary depending on the country&nbsp;: the FCC allocates
both the 900&nbsp;MHz and 2.4&nbsp;GHz band with 1&nbsp;W maximum
power, whereas the ETSI allocates only the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band with
100&nbsp;mW maximum power. The 2.4&nbsp;GHz band is available
worldwide and the regulations are mostly compatible between the
different authorities (usually 80&nbsp;MHz of bandwidth between
2.4&nbsp;GHz and 2.48&nbsp;GHz). The main exception is Japan which has
some additional constraints.
<p>
Because these bands are &quot;free&quot;, they may be heavily
<B>polluted</B> by other unlicensed systems. The 2.4&nbsp;GHz band
also suffers from the microwave oven radiation (this explains why it
was given for free).

<H3>4.2	5 GHz frequency bands</H3>
The <B>5&nbsp;GHz unlicensed bands</B> are another very complicated
story, and I prefer to wait until the mess is sorted out to talk in
details about it. In Europe, so far, the 5.2&nbsp;GHz band is
dedicated to <I>HiperLan</I>, and nothing else (apart for HiperLan II,
but it is still in the early stages of specification). In the States,
there is some chunks in the 5&nbsp;GHz band (<I>UNII band</I>)
available with very liberal rules (Spread Spectrum is not mandated, no
channels allocated, different power maximums depending on the chunk).
<p>
In the 5&nbsp;GHz band, because of the availability of more bandwidth,
higher speed are possible (10 to 40&nbsp;Mb/s - note that it is also
theoretically possible to get such speeds in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band by
cheating a bit with the rules). But, a higher band means also a
reduced range and more sensitivity to obstacles, which is bad news.

<A NAME="spreadspectrum">
<H3>4.3 Spread Spectrum techniques</H3>
</A>
<B>Spread spectrum</B> is a technique (mainly pioneered by the army)
trading bandwidth for reliability. The goal is to use more bandwidth
than the system really needs for transmission to reduce the impact of
localised interferences (bad frequencies) on the system. Spread
spectrum, as it prevents one system to use the full bandwidth
capacity, allows systems to share the bandwidth. In the 2.4&nbsp;GHz
band, the regulation specifies that systems have to use one of the two
main spread spectrum technique&nbsp;: <I>Direct Sequence</I> or
<I>Frequency Hopping</I>.
<p>
Which one is better&nbsp;? This is the main technical war between the
radio LAN vendors. Everybody, of course, argue that its own technology
is better. For now, no one has come with some decisive arguments about
the comparative performance and robustness of these two technologies
(estimating performance of radio systems is a tricky job). Of course,
comparing products doesn't make sense because the performance of a
system depend on many other components (the MAC protocol, the
signalling rate), the optimisation chosen (performance versus
reliability) and the actual implementation (hum, hum...).

<H4>4.3.1 Direct Sequence</H4>
The principle of <B>Direct Sequence</B> is to <I>spread</I> the signal
on a larger band, to minimise localised interference and background
noise.
<p>
The system works over a fixed large channel. To spread the signal,
each bit of the packet to transmit is sur-modulated by a <I>code</I>
(a fast repetitive pattern). In the receiver, the original signal is
recovered by receiving the whole spread channel (averaging effect) and
demodulating by the same code. For a 2&nbsp;Mb/s signalling rate
modulated by a 11 chips code (like the Wavelan), the result is a
signal spread over 22&nbsp;MHz of bandwidth.
<p>
Any narrowband interferer, because it uses only a small part of the
spread bandwidth, will appear much weaker to the Direct Sequence
system (I think it will be much clearer if you look at the picture
below).
<p>
This is also the principle used by <I>CDMA</I> (one of the cellular
phone technique), but in CDMA each individual phone is given a
different code on the same channel. Because of this fast modulation, a
DS modem is quite complicated. One the other hand, the fact of having
one single fixed channel eases the task of the higher layers (MAC).
<p>

</CENTER>

<p>
Because it uses a large channel, a Direct Sequence system has only a
few channels available in the bandwidth (3 for the <I>Wavelan</I> - on
different frequencies). Those channels are totally separate (they
don't generate interferences on each other). Direct Sequence also
offers the possibility to use partially overlapping channels for
systems in adjacent areas, increasing slightly the number of
channels. But this last solution tends to increase the noise and
decrease the performance of the system.

<H4>4.3.2 Frequency Hopping</H4>
<B>Frequency Hopping</B> uses a set of narrow channels and walk
through all of them in sequence. For example, the 2.4&nbsp;GHz ISM
band is divided in 79 channels of 1&nbsp;MHz. Periodically (every 20
to 400&nbsp;ms usually), the system <I>hop</I> to a new channel,
following a predetermined cyclic <I>hopping pattern</I>.
<p>

The system avoids interferences by never staying on the same
channel&nbsp;: if a channel is bad, the system might not be able to
use it and just waits for the next good channel. As the pattern makes
the whole network hop through all the bandwidth available, the system
average the effect of bad channels over the time.
<p>

<CENTER><I>Frequency Hopping&nbsp;:</I>
<p>
<IMG SRC="FH.gif"></CENTER>

<p>
On the other hand, Frequency Hopping introduces more complications at
the MAC level&nbsp;: scanning to find the network at the
initialisation (a moving target), keeping the synchronisation of the
nodes, managing the hops.
<p>
This complexity of the MAC has a price in term of performance, and the
Frequency Hopping mechanism has some overhead. There is management
overhead to manage the synchronisation, and there is some dead time in
the transmission when the system hop. In theory, this can be kept to a
minimum.
<p>
Also, the Frequency Hopping system have to include a process called
whitening, to conform to radio transmission constraints, adding some
regular stuff bits in each packets, adding more overhead (a Direct
Sequence signal is withened by the Direct Sequence process).
<p>
The Frequency Hopping technique can accommodate much more independent
systems collocated in the same area than the Direct Sequence technique
by using different hopping pattern (up to 15 for the
<I>RangeLan2</I>). On the other hand, the different hopping patterns
of Frequency Hopping will &quot;collide&quot; on the same (or
adjacent) frequency from time to time. The collision of the Frequency
Hopping pattern may reduce the throughput significantly&nbsp;: the
systems &quot;colliding&quot; on the same (or an adjacent) frequency
will have to share the bandwidth between them (see discussions on
aggregate throughput in <A HREF="#aggregate"><I>chapter
5.9.4</I></A>).

<H4>4.3.3 Comparison...</H4>
In term of complexity, the Direct Sequence modem is more complicated
than the Frequency Hopping one, and the Direct Sequence has a simpler
MAC protocol. With the increasing integration of digital hardware, it
doesn't cost much more to implement the specific MAC functionalities
required for the Frequency Hopping system, and as the price of the
modem is a big portion of a radio LAN and doesn't follow the same cost
reduction trends, Frequency Hopping systems will tend to be cheaper.
<p>
In term of bandwidth sharing, the two technologies perform really
differently. The same is true in term of resistance to
interferences. Direct Sequence systems tend also to have a lower
overhead on the air.
<p>
In summary, most vendors are going to Frequency Hopping because of the
lower cost and try to convince people that it is better, and vendors
having heavily invested in Direct Sequence try to push their raw
performance advantage, so it is still a kind of religion war.

<A NAME="multirate">
<H3>4.4 Multi-rate systems</H3>
</A>
If you want a better throughput, the most simple way is to use more
bandwidth. The problem is that the ISM spread spectrum regulations
limits the amount of bandwidth usable (1&nbsp;MHz for Frequency
Hopping). This limit the rate of symbols that you can use
(1&nbsp;Mbauds for Frequency Hopping).
<p>
So, how could some Frequency Hopping systems offer 3&nbsp;Mb/s in
1&nbsp;MHz channels&nbsp;? The use of more complex <B>modulation</B>
schemes allows to overcome this limitation. For example, the standard
2FSK allows to put 1 bit per symbol, whereas 4FSK allows 2 bits per
symbols, doubling the signalling rate.
<p>
Of course, there is a drawback&nbsp;: a more complex modulation scheme
is less robust and will require a higher received signal to noise
ratio to work (SNR - see <A HREF="#snr"><I>chapter
4.7.4</I></A>). This is because each time the receiver reads a symbol,
instead of having to distinguish two fairly separated values, now it
has to distinguish 4 closer to each other. So, we have the choice
between a high speed modulation which requires strong received signal
and a slower modulation which works even on weak signals. In other
words, the higher the signalling rate, the shorter the range.
<p>
Because users want both range and speed, some vendors have build some
systems using multiple levels of modulations, changing automatically
from the fast modulation to the robust one depending on the channel
conditions. This introduces a bit of overhead and complexity, but the
system offer a much better performance characteristic (range or
speed).

<H3>4.5 Diversity</H3>
<B>Diversity</B> is a generic concept of introducing redundancy in the
system to overcome noise and to increase the reliability of the
system. For example, <I>spread spectrum</I> is a type of frequency
diversity, using more bandwidth than necessary to avoid bad parts of
the spectrum. <I>Retransmission</I> is a very usual temporal
diversity. <I>FEC</I> (Forward Error Correction) is another kind of
temporal diversity. Very often, &quot;diversity&quot; is associated
with <I>antenna diversity</I> only. Antenna diversity is only one form
of diversity (a spacial diversity).
<p>
<B>Antenna diversity</B> means that the radio device has two (or more)
antennas. The transmission conditions on the channel vary a lot over
the time. The channel tends to fade in and fade out, so the device has
moment of good reception and moment of bad reception. But, these
conditions are also dependant on the spacial position. By having two
antennas, even quite close, the condition at each antenna is very
often totally different. So, before receiving each packet, the
receiver chooses the best antenna of the two by comparing the signal
strengths, and so avoids most of the fade out periods.

<H3>4.6 Directional antennas</H3>
Most wireless LANs use omnidirectional antennas, but may offer
<B>directional antennas</B> in option. Instead of receiving in every
directions, the directional antenna favour reception in a more or less
narrow angle. The narrower the angle is, the higher the gain is (and
the range), because you get rid of more unwanted emissions and
background noise in the other directions.
<p>
With directional antennas, it is quite common to have a few kilometres
of range in line of sight with products in the ISM band. The first
problem is that you must of course point each antenna towards the node
you intend to communicate with (depending on the angle this needs to
be more or less precise). The second problem is that very directional
antennas tend to be quite big.
<p>
This is why directional antennas are only suited for fixed point to
point links (products like <B>Wireless Bridges</B>). For most networks
where nodes need to talk to different other nodes in different
directions and might need to move, omnidirectional antennas are much
more practical.

<A NAME="range">
<H3>4.7 Range issues</H3>
</A>
The <B>propagation</B> of radio transmissions is influenced by many
factors. Walls and floors tend to decrease and reflect the signal, and
background noise makes it more difficult to demodulate. In a typical
environment, all the shadows due to obstacles and reflections on the
walls create a very unpredictable quality of transmission for each
specific location. The channel quality also vary quite a lot over the
time (<I>fading</I>) because the environment is not static.
<p>
Because of the way radio transmissions are affected by the environment
in such a complex way, it is quite difficult to predict the
comportment of the system and to define a <B>range</B>. You will have
some good, fair and bad area/period, the closer the two devices are
the more likely they are to be in a good one.
<p>
Most vendors attempt to define a range for their products, which is
the average maximum distance in usual operating conditions between two
nodes (diameter of a <B>cell</B> - radio neighbourhood). Some even
give different ranges for different typical environments. For
example&nbsp;: open environment (no obstacles), semi-open (cubicles)
and closed (real walls).
<p>
But there is no standard and common operating procedure to measure a
range (except in free space, but this is useless), so we can't really
compare the different products from the ranges as indicated in their
data-sheets, and you must take these values with a bit of caution.
<p>
If you want to compare products in term of range performance, you must
look closely at the <I>transmitted power</I> and <I>sensitivity</I>
values. These are some measurable characteristics of the hardware
which indicate the performance of the product in that respect.

<H4>4.7.1 Transmitted power</H4>
The <B>transmitted power</B> is the strength of the emissions measured
in Watts (or milliWatts). We have already seen that the regulations
limit this power. Products having a high transmit power will also be
likely to drain the batteries faster. But, having a high transmit
power will help to emit signals stronger than the interferers in the
band (and other systems).
<p>
Having a strong transmitted power has some drawback for <I>frequency
reuse</I>. This means that if you want to put many different networks
in areas close to each other, they will tend to pollute each
other. With less transmitted power you can make smaller cells. This is
why some product may allow to select different transmitted powers.

<H4>4.7.2 Sensitivity</H4>
The <B>sensitivity</B> is the measure of the weakest signal that may
be reliably heard on the channel by the receiver (it is able to read
the bits from the antenna with a low error probability). This
indicates the performance of the receiver, and the lower the value the
better the hardware (higher in absolute value). The figure is given in
dBm, the magic formula to transform power in Watts to dBm is&nbsp;:
<I>P dBm = 30 + 10.log(P W)</I>. Usual values are around -80&nbsp;dBm.

<H4>4.7.3 Attenuation</H4>
Knowing those two values, you may calculate the maximum possible
<B>attenuation</B> of the packets (this is the difference between the
two values, in dB). The larger the maximum possible attenuation, the
larger the range. For a 100&nbsp;mW system with a -80&nbsp;dBm
sensitivity, we have 100&nbsp;dB maximum attenuation.
<p>
The attenuation is the decrease of signal strength between the
transmitter and the receiver. If you know exactly the composition of
the signal paths between the two (distance in the air, type of
obstacles, reflections...), you may calculate the attenuation, but
usually it is quite tricky to determine the attenuation as a function
of the distance.
<p>
Because of this non straightforward relationship, knowing the maximum
possible attenuation won't give you the maximum range, but just a
feeling. The only safe thing is that products with a greater maximum
possible attenuation are very likely to have a larger range.

<A NAME="snr">
<H4>4.7.4 Signal to noise ratio (SNR)</H4>
</A>
In the case of multirate systems, I've been talking of <B>Signal to
Noise ratio</B> (SNR). The sensitivity is in fact closely linked to
the minimum SNR of the modem. The SNR defines the difference of power
in the receiver between a valid signal and a noise. To be able to
decode successfully the received signal, the receiver needs a minimum
SNR (i.e. the signal not too much polluted by the noise). This minimum
SNR depends on the quality of the receiver hardware and the modulation
chosen (see <A HREF="#multirate"><I>chapter 4.4</I></A> on multi rate
systems).
<p>
So, the link between sensitivity and minimum SNR is quite obvious. If
you add the minimum SNR to the background noise in the receiver
(hardware noise and background noise on the channel), you will find
the sensitivity. So, having a low sensitivity means also a low minimum
SNR, so the ability to receive reliably packets with potentially
higher interference strength, which explain why the sensitivity is
such an important performance characteristic.

<H2>5 The MAC level</H2>
This section of the document focus on the next layer up, the link
layer. This mostly comprise the <B>MAC</B> (Medium Access Control)
protocol. Different MAC protocols and techniques are presented.

<A NAME="tdma">
<H3>5.1 TDMA</H3>
</A>
In this chapter, we discuss <B>TDMA</B> (Time Division Multiplex
Access) as a channel access mechanism and not its applications and
protocols based on it. A <I>channel access mechanism</I> is a way to
divide the main resource, the radio channel, by regulating the use of
it. The channel access mechanism is the core of the <I>MAC
protocol</I>.
<p>
TDMA is very simple. A specific node, the base station, has the
responsibility to coordinate the nodes of the network. The time on the
channel is divided into <I>time slots</I>, which are generally of
fixed size. Each node of the network is allocated a certain number of
slots where it can transmit. Slots are usually organised in a frame,
which is repeated on a regular basis.
<p>

<CENTER><I>TDMA channel access mechanism&nbsp;:</I>
<p>
<IMG SRC="TDMA.gif"></CENTER>

<p>
The base station specify in the beacon (a management frame) the
organisation of the frame. Each node just needs to follow blindly the
instruction of the base station. Very often, the frame is organised as
downlink (base station to node) and uplink (node to base station)
slots, and all the communications goes through the base station. A
service slot allows a node to request the allocation of a slot, by
sending a connection request message in it.
<p>
TDMA suits very well phone applications, because those application
have very predictable needs (fixed and identical bit rate). Each
handset is allocated a downlink and a uplink slot of a fixed size (the
size of the voice data for the duration of the frame). This is no
surprise why TDMA is used into all cellular phone (GSM in Europe, TDMA
and CDMA in the USA) and cordless phone (DECT in Europe)
standards. TDMA is also very good to achieve low latency and guarantee
of bandwidth (where CSMA/CA is quite bad).
<p>
TDMA is not well suited for data networking applications, because it
is very strict and inflexible. IP is connectionless and generates
bursty traffic which is very unpredictable by nature, while TDMA is
connection oriented (so it has to suffer the overhead of creating
connections for single IP packets). TDMA use fixed size packets and
usually symmetrical link, which doesn't suit IP that well.
<p>
TDMA is very much dependant of the quality of the frequency band. In a
dedicated clean band, as it is the case for cellular phone standard,
TDMA is fine. But, because of it's inflexibility, and because it
doesn't really take care of what's happening on the channel, TDMA
can't cope and adapt to the bursty interference sources found in the
unlicensed bands.

<A NAME="csma">
<H3>5.2 CSMA/CA</H3>
</A>
<B>CSMA/CA</B> (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance) is
the <I>channel access</I> mechanism used by most wireless LANs in the
ISM bands. A channel access mechanism is the part of the
<I>protocol</I> which specifies how the node uses the medium&nbsp;:
when to listen, when to transmit...
<p>
The basic principles of CSMA/CA are <I>listen before talk</I> and
<I>contention</I>. This is an <I>asynchronous</I> message passing
mechanism (connectionless), delivering a best effort service, but no
bandwidth and latency guarantee (you are still following&nbsp;?). It's
main advantages are that it is suited for network protocols such as
TCP/IP, adapts quite well with the variable condition of traffic and
is quite robust against interferences.
<p>
CSMA/CA is fundamentally different from the channel access mechanism
used by cellular phone systems (see <I>TDMA</I> in <A
HREF="#tdma"><I>chapter 5.1</I></A>).
<p>
CSMA/CA is derived from CSMA/CD (Collision Detection), which is the
base of <I>Ethernet</I>. The main difference is the <I>carrier
sense</I>&nbsp;: on a wire, the transceiver has the ability to listen
while transmitting and so to detect collisions. But, if with a wire
all transmissions have approximately the same strength, even if a
radio node could listen on the channel while transmitting, the
strength of its transmissions would mask all other signals on the
air. So, the protocol can't directly detect collisions like with
<I>Ethernet</I> and only tries to avoid them.
<p>
The protocol starts by listening on the channel (this is called
carrier sense), and if it is found to be idle, it sends the first
packet in the transmit queue. If it is busy (either another node
transmission or interference), the node waits the end of the current
transmission and then starts the <B>contention</B> (wait a random
amount of time). When its contention timer expires, if the channel is
still idle, the node sends the packet. The node having chosen the
shortest contention delay wins and transmits its packet. Because the
contention is a random number and done for every packets, each node is
given an equal chance to access the channel (on average - it is
statistic).
<p>
As we have mentioned, we can't detect collisions on the radio, and
because the radio needs time to switch from receive to transmit, this
contention is usually <B>slotted</B> (a transmission may start only at
the beginning of a slot&nbsp;: 50&nbsp;ms in 802.11). This makes the
average contention delay larger, but reduces greatly the collisions
(we can't totally avoid them).
<p>

<p>
<IMG SRC="Contention.gif"></CENTER>

<A NAME="retry">
<H3>5.3 MAC retransmissions</H3>
</A>
As we have seen in the previous chapter, the main problem of the
<I>CSMA/CA protocol</I> is that it can't detect collisions in the
transmitter. There is also a higher error rate on the air than on a
wire, so a higher chance of packets being corrupted. TCP doesn't like
very much packet losses at the <I>MAC layer</I> (see TCP and packet
losses problem - <A HREF="#tcp"><I>chapter 5.9.3</I></A>). Because of
that, most MAC protocols also implement <B>positive
acknowledgement</B> and <B>MAC level retransmissions</B> to avoid
losing packets on the air.
<p>
The principle is quite simple&nbsp;: each time a node receives a
packet, it sends back immediately a short message (an ack) to the
transmitter to indicate that it has successfully received the packet
without errors. If after sending a packet the transmitter doesn't
receive an ack, it knows that the packet was lost, so it will
retransmit the packet (after contending again for the medium).
<p>
The acks are &quot;embedded&quot; in the MAC protocol, so they are
guaranteed not to collide (the contention starts after the ack). These
acks are very different from the TCP acks, which work at a different
level (and on a different time frame). Of course, broadcast and
multicast packets are not acknowledged, so they are more likely to
fail...
<p>
If all modern Wireless LAN protocols implement this essential feature,
some old products may lack it. Wireless WAN protocols don't implement
that either, because the round trip delay in their case is so long
that by the time they would receive the ack they could have sent
another packet. If your Wireless LAN doesn't implement MAC level
retransmissions, all is not lost&nbsp;: students of Berkeley have
created a protocol called <I>snoop</I> (see at <A
HREF="ftp://daedalus.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/snoop/">
ftp://daedalus.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/snoop/</A>) which filters the TCP
acks and retransmits the lost packets before TCP even notices that
they are lost (this is still a link level retransmission, but done
just over the MAC).

<A NAME="frags">
<H3>5.4 Fragmentation</H3>
</A>
The radio medium has a higher <I>error rate</I> than a wire. We have
explained in the previous chapter that it was why most products were
including MAC level retransmissions to avoid losing packets.
<p>
MAC level retransmissions solve this problem, but is not really
performant. If the packet to transmit is long and contains only one
error, the node needs to retransmit it entirely. If the error rate is
significantly high, we could come to some situation were the
probability of error in large packet is dangerously close to 1, so we
can't get packet through.
<p>
This is why some products use <B>fragmentation</B>. Fragmentation is
sending the big packets in small pieces over the medium. Of course,
this adds some overhead, because it duplicates packet headers in every
fragments. Each fragment is individually checked and retransmitted if
necessary. The first advantage is that in case of error, the node
needs only to retransmit one small fragment, so it is faster. The
second advantage is that if the medium is very noisy, a small packet
has a higher probability to get through without errors, so the node
increases its chance of success in bad conditions.

<H3>5.5 RTS/CTS</H3>
In the chapter about range (<A HREF="#range"><I>chater 4.7</I></A>),
we have seen that the main effect of transmission on radio waves is
the attenuation of the signal. Because of this attenuation, we have
very commonly a problem of <I>hidden nodes</I>.
<p>
The hidden node problem comes from the fact that all nodes may not
hear each other because the attenuation is too strong between
them. Because transmissions are based on the carrier sense mechanism,
those nodes ignore each other and may transmit at the same time (they
are effectively in different cells). Usually, this is a good thing
because it allows <I>frequency reuse</I>.
<p>
But, for a node placed in between, these simultaneous transmissions
have a comparable strength and so collide (in its receiver). This node
could be impossible to reach because of these collisions.
<p>
The fundamental problem with carrier sense only is that the
transmitter tries to estimate if the channel is free at the receiver
with only local information. The situation might be quite different
between those two nodes.
<p>
An simple and elegant solution to this problem (proposed by <A
HREF="http://people.qualcomm.com/karn/">Phil Karn</A> in his MACA
protocol for AX.25) is to use <B>RTS/CTS</B> (Request To Send/Clear To
Send). RTS/CTS is a <I>handshaking</I>&nbsp;: before sending a packet,
the transmitter sends a RTS and wait for a CTS from the receiver. The
reception of a CTS indicates that the receiver is able to receive the
RTS, so the packet (the channel is clear in its area).
<p>
At the same time, every node in the range of the receiver hears the
CTS (even if it doesn't hear the RTS), so understands that a
transmission is going on. The nodes hearing the CTS are the nodes that
could potentially create collisions in the receiver (assuming a
symmetric channel). Because these nodes may not hear the data
transmission, the RTS and CTS messages contain the size of the
expected transmission (to know how long the transmission will
last). This is the <I>collision avoidance</I> feature of the RTS/CTS
mechanism (also called <I>virtual carrier sense</I>)&nbsp;: all nodes
avoid accessing the channel after hearing the CTS even if their
carrier sense indicate that the medium is free.
<p>
RTS/CTS has another advantage&nbsp;: it lowers the overhead of a
collision on the medium (collisions are much shorter in time). If two
nodes attempt to transmit in the same slot of the contention window,
their RTS collide and they don't receive any CTS, so they loose only a
RTS, whereas in the normal scenario they would have lost a whole
packet.
<p>
Because the RTS/CTS handshaking adds a significant overhead, usually
it is not used for small packets.

<H3>5.6 Polling MAC</H3>
<B>Polling</B> is the third major channel access mechanism, after
<I>TDMA</I> and <I>CSMA/CA </I>(see <A HREF="#tdma"><I>chapter
5.1</I></A> and <A HREF="#csma"><I>chapter 5.2</I></A> respectively -
There exist also Token Ring, but I guess that nobody would be crazy
enough to implement it on a radio link). The most successful
networking standard using polling is 100vg (IEEE 802.12), but some
wireless standard are also using it. For example, <I>802.11</I> offers
a polling channel access mechanism (Point Coordination Function) in
addition to the CSMA/CA one.
<p>
Polling is in fact in between TDMA and CSMA/CA. The base station
retains total control over the channel, but the frame content is no
more fixed, allowing variable size packets to be sent. The base
station sends a specific packet (a poll packet) to trigger the
transmission by the node. The node just wait to receive a poll packet,
and upon reception sends what it has to transmit.
<p>

<CENTER><I>Polling channel Access Mechanisms&nbsp;:</I>
<p>
<IMG SRC="Polling.gif"></CENTER>

<p>
Polling can be implemented as a connection oriented service (very much
like TDMA, but with higher flexibility in packet size) or connection
less service (in this case, there is the overhead of polling nodes
just to check if they have something to transmit).
<p>
In the case of 100vg, the polling mechanism doesn't use any bandwidth,
leading to a very efficient use of the channel (over 96&nbsp;% user
throughput). For 802.11 and wireless LAN, all the polling packets have
to be transmitted over the air, generating much more overhead.
<p>
As CSMA/CA offers ad-hoc networking (no need of a base station) and
similar performance, it is usually preferred in most wireless
LANs. For example, most 802.11 vendors prefer to use the distributed
mode (CSMA/CA) over the coordinated mode (polling).

<A NAME="ap">
<H3>5.7 Access Points and Roaming</H3>
</A>
Wireless networks are sometime isolated networks (called ad-hoc), but
most of the time they need to be connected to the rest of the world
(and the Internet&nbsp;:-). This is usually done through <B>Access
Points</B>.
<p>
In fact, an Access Point is simply a <B>bridge</B>, connected on one
side to the radio network and on the other side to <I>Ethernet</I>
(usually), forwarding packets between the two networks. A bridge works
at the MAC level, just looking through the MAC headers to make its
decisions (filtering) and changing MAC headers according to the MAC
protocol used. This means that <I>NetBeui</I> and <I>IPX</I> work
across the access point, and that the nodes connected to the radio
must use the same <I>TCP/IP subnet</I> as the Ethernet segment the
access point is connected to.
<p>
Because of the interactions with MAC level acknowledgement, most of
the time bridging on Wireless LAN is not as simple and transparent as
on Ethernet, and a specific scheme is designed in the MAC
protocol. But, most of the time this is transparent to the higher
layers (if the MAC and the driver do correctly their job), and you
might just configure a Linux box with a bridge software as a cheap
access point...
<p>
In fact, most radio access points provide more than this simple
bridging functionality. Most of them provide <I>access control</I> (to
prevent any unwanted radio node to access the network), <I>roaming</I>
and <I>out of range forwarding</I>.
<p>
The use of the last two features requires that all the access points
that are used to cover the desired area are connected on the same
wired segment (IP subnet). Each node needs to register to one of the
access point (to avoid confusion between the AP), the nearest one,
usually. If the node moves, it will automatically switch from one
access point to another to retain its access to the wired network
(that is <B>roaming</B>). If a node wants to communicate with a node
which is not in its reach, its access point forwards the packets
through the wired network and via the access point where the
destination is registered (that is <B>out of range forwarding</B>).
<p>
A few systems use as well the access point as a network central
coordinator of the channel access mechanism (TDMA and polling
mode). This is a bad idea, because it decreases the overall
reliability and flexibility of the system&nbsp;: every node must be
able to communicate at any time the access point in order to work,
even if it wants to communicate with a close neighbour.

<H3>5.8 MAC forwarding</H3>
The forwarding mechanism designed around <I>Access Points</I> (see <A
HREF="#ap"><I>chapter 5.7</I></A>) requires a fixed wired
infrastructure to link the Access Point. This might be satisfactory
for most usages, but is not adequate for ad-hoc networks.
<p>
Some MAC protocol (such as HiperLan - see <A
HREF="#hiperlan"><I>chapter 6.2</I></A>) provide a MAC level
forwarding, where every node of the network can be used to relay the
message on the air to the destination. The protocol doesn't rely any
more on a fixed infrastructure, but on all the wireless nodes on the
path.
<p>
This forwarding mechanism use management message to propagate network
changes and the new optimal routes. Nodes must implement the
forwarding capability and propagate message based on those routing
tables. In fact, each node of the network acts as a ad-hoc wireless
bridge.

<H3>5.9 Some throughput considerations</H3>
If the physical layer people are mostly talking range and dB, MAC
layer people are (or should be) concerned about the throughput of the
system.

<H4>5.9.1 Signalling rate versus maximum user throughput</H4>
Like for wired products, most radio LAN vendors indicate only the
<B>signalling rate</B> of their products. For example, <I>Ethernet</I>
is 10&nbsp;Mb/s, 100&nbsp;Mb/s or 1 Gb/s, and most radio LAN products
between 0.5 and 3&nbsp;Mb/s (higher rate like 10&nbsp;Mb/s are slowly
coming to the market). The signalling rate is the speed at which bits
are transmitted over the medium, but, because of the many overheads of
the protocols used to communicate, the user throughput is usually less
(note also that for them 1&nbsp;Mb/s is
10<SUP>6</SUP>&nbsp;b/s&nbsp;!). The Wireless LANs protocols have
usually a <B>higher overhead</B> than their wired counterpart (such as
Ethernet). This is due to different factors&nbsp;:
<p>
The first is the <I>radio technology</I>&nbsp;: radio receivers
require large synchronisation fields (receiver training, antenna
selection...)&nbsp;; the radio itself is slow to react (switch from
receive to transmit), so needs large slots in the contention window
and between packets.
<p>
The second is the addition of the <I>features</I> necessary for the
radio protocol which makes the packet MAC headers larger (fields for
network id, encryption parameters...) or introduces new management
packets (synchronisation, authentication, access point
registration). For multirate systems, even when using the fast
modulation scheme, quite often the packet headers are transmitted with
the robust and slower one, so adding more overhead.
<p>
The third is that some <I>trade-offs</I> are made to improve the
reliability. For example, we might split big packets into small
independent fragments to decrease the error probability (see <A
HREF="#frags"><I>chapter 5.4</I></A> on fragmentation). Acks and
RTS/CTS add also some overhead. Having a slotted contention decreases
the collisions but makes the average contention delay larger as well.
<p>
When you add all this, it starts to make a significant difference. If
in the case of Ethernet you may hope to reach 80-95&nbsp;% of the
signalling rate, for most radio products, despite being slower, the
user throughput is usually between 50 and 70&nbsp;% of the signalling
rate (or even less...).

<H4>5.9.2 Shared throughput versus individual throughput</H4>
In the previous chapter, we have examined the overhead added by the
protocol and talked about the maximum user throughput usable by the
Wireless LAN. But, sometimes, even in a clear channel, the maximum
<B>node to node throughput</B> may be even less than that. This is
usually caused by implementation problems.
<p>
The most obvious is for example a slow interface between the PC and
the Wireless device. A serial or parallel interface is slower than an
ISA or Pcmcia bus and may be a bottleneck.
<p>
The second example is devices implementing only one transmit
buffer. This saves some cost (memory, complexity), but, as the buffer
may be either written by the driver or transmitted over the air but
not both at the same time, this creates dead time over the air while
the driver refills the buffer and reduces the available
throughput. This was one of the performance gain between the first and
the second generation of Ethernet cards in the old days.
<p>
The protocol might also performs better when many node are active than
when only one of them transmits. For example, a polling protocol which
uses a round robin scheduling mechanism and asks each node in turn if
it has a packet to transmit performs better is every node has
something to send than only one node (in this case, between each
packet of this node the protocol has to pool all the other nodes of
the network for nothing).

<A NAME="tcp">
<H4>5.9.3 TCP and packet losses problem</H4>
</A>
TCP has been developed for wired LAN, where packet losses are
minimal. If a packet is lost, TCP assumes that it is dropped in a
router or a bridge because of <B>congestion</B>. To try to reduce the
congestion, TCP slows down drastically.
<p>
On the radio medium, collisions can't be detected and the error rate
is higher, so there is more packet losses. TCP sees that as congestion
and reduces its throughput, and so doesn't use all the available
bandwidth.
<p>
In modern Wireless LAN, <B>MAC level retransmissions</B> (see <A
HREF="#retry"><I>chapter 5.3</I></A>) solve totally this problem by
detecting and eliminating packet losses due to errors and collisions,
TCP sees a reliable channel and has no reason to slow down (except if
MAC level retransmissions are poorly implemented).

<A NAME="aggregate">
<H4>5.9.4 Aggregate throughput</H4>
</A>
It's quite common practice for vendors to advertise for their products
something called <B>aggregate throughput</B>. This figure indicates
the maximum throughput that it is possible to transmit in the full
bandwidth by having different adjacent and independent networks on
different frequencies or hopping patterns.
<p>
Of course, the user of the Wireless LAN will never see such a
throughput, and it is a bit like advocating that by having 10
<I>Ethernet 10baseT</I> cables you are able to have a 100&nbsp;Mb/s
throughput... But, it gives an indication of how well overlapping
cells will share the bandwidth.
<p>
For example, with a Frequency Hopping system having 1.6&nbsp;Mb/s user
throughput, by putting 15 networks, each on a different hopping
pattern, we should have in theory a 24&nbsp;Mb/s aggregate
throughput. In fact, because the different Frequency Hopping patterns
&quot;collide&quot; on the same frequency (and also suffer from
co-channel interference) from time to time, the actual aggregate
throughput is less, and is in this example only 15&nbsp;Mb/s.
<p>
These collisions of the hopping patterns is why Frequency Hopping
can't offer up to 79 networks on the 79 channels (but only up to 15 in
this case)...

<H2>6 Some Wireless LAN standards</H2>
A short gallery of the most famous Wireless LAN standard (but
unfortunately not yes the most widespread...).

<H3>6.1 IEEE 802.11</H3>
The main problem of radio networks acceptance in the market place is
that there is not one <B>unique standard</B> like Ethernet with a
guaranteed compatibility between all devices, but many proprietary
standards pushed by each independent vendor and incompatible between
themselves. Because corporate customers require an established unique
standard, most of the vendors have joined the IEEE in a effort to
create a standard for radio LANs. This is <B>IEEE 802.11</B> (like
<I>Ethernet</I> is <I>IEEE 802.3</I>, <I>Token Ring</I> is <I>IEEE
802.5</I> and <I>100vg</I> is <I>IEEE 802.12</I>).
<p>
Of course, once in the 802.11 committee, each vendor has pushed its
own technologies and specificities in the standard to try to make the
standard closer to its product. The result is a standard which took
too much time too complete, which is overcomplicated and bloated with
features, and might be obsoleted before products come to market by
newer technologies. But it is a standard based on experience,
versatile and well designed and including all of the optimisations and
clever techniques developed by the different vendors.
<p>
The 802.11 standard specifies one MAC protocol and 3 physical
layers&nbsp;: Frequency Hopping 1&nbsp;Mb/s (only), Direct Sequence 1
and 2&nbsp;Mb/s and diffuse infrared (can we really call it a
&quot;standard&quot; when in includes 3 incompatible physical
layers&nbsp;?). The MAC has two main standards of operation, a
distributed mode (CSMA/CA), and a coordinated mode (polling
mode). 802.11 of course uses MAC level retransmissions, and also
RTS/CTS and fragmentation.
<p>
The optional power management features are quite complex. The 802.11
MAC protocol also includes optional authentication and encryption. On
the other hand, 802.11 lacks to defines some area (multirate, roaming,
inter AP communication...), that might be covered by future
developments of the standard or complementary standards.
<p>
The fact that 802.11 has just recently been finalised (september 97)
and is quite complicated causes most vendors to be slow to implement
802.11 products (and they also need to provide backward compatibility
with their own previous line of products). The complexity of the
specification and the tightness of the requirements make 802.11
products expensive compared to the previous generation of wireless
LANs.
<p>
Even if vendors eventually launch 802.11 products, the standard
doesn't fully guarantee inter-operability&nbsp;: the products have to
use at least the same physical layer, the same bit rate and the same
mode of operation (and there is other details...).
<p>
After 7 years of arguing in sub-committees making 802.11, you would
think that most people would had enough of it. In fact no, the 802.11
committee is now busy working creating a new standard at 5&nbsp;GHz,
and also for higher speed at 2.4&nbsp;GHz (by tweaking the Direct
Sequence physical layer - if they can get it accepted by the FCC).
<p>
In fact, I believe that the 5&nbsp;GHz version of 802.11 will be
standardised soon, before the 5&nbsp;GHz products are common place, so
802.11 might be much more successful at 5&nbsp;GHz than it has been at
2.4&nbsp;GHz. At 5&nbsp;GHz, the higher cost of the modem will also
absorb most of the 802.11 MAC cost.

<A NAME="hiperlan">
<H3>6.2 HiperLan</H3>
</A>
<B>Hiperlan</B> is the total opposite of <I>802.11</I>. This standard
has been designed by a committee of researcher within the <B>ETSI</B>,
without strong vendors influence, and is quite different from existing
products. The standard is quite simple, uses some advanced features,
and has already been ratified a while ago (summer 96 - we are now only
waiting for the products).
<p>
The first main advantage of Hiperlan is that it works in a dedicated
bandwidth (5.1 to 5.3&nbsp;GHz, allocated only in Europe), and so
doesn't have to include spread spectrum. The signalling rate is
23.5&nbsp;Mb/s, and 5 fixed channels are defined. The protocol uses a
variant of CSMA/CA based on packet time to live and priority, and MAC
level retransmissions. The protocol includes optional encryption and
power saving.
<p>
The nicest feature of Hiperlan (apart from the high speed) is the
ad-hoc routing&nbsp;: if your destination is out of reach,
intermediate nodes will automatically forward it through the optimal
route within the Hiperlan network (the routes are regularly
automatically recalculated). Hiperlan is also totally ad-hoc,
requiring no configuration and no central controller.
<p>
The main deficiency of Hiperlan standard is that it doesn't provide
real isochronous services (but comes quite close with time to live and
priority), doesn't fully specify the access point mechanism and hasn't
really been proved to work on a large scale in the real
world. Overhead tend also to be quite large (really big packet
headers).
<p>
HiperLan suffers from the same disease as 802.11&nbsp;: the
requirements are tight and the protocol complex, making it very
expensive.

<H3>6.3 HomeRF &amp; SWAP</H3>
The <B>HomeRF</B> is a group of big companies from different
background formed to push the usage of Wireless LAN in the home and
the small office. This group is developing and promoting a new Radio
Lan standard&nbsp;: <B>SWAP</B>.
<p>
The Home is a good market for Wireless LAN because very few houses are
nowadays cabled with Ethernet wire between the different rooms, and
because mobility in the home is desired (browse the web on the
sofa). The use of the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band allows a free worldwide
deployment of the system.
<p>
The HomeRF has decided to tackle the main obstacle preventing the
deployment of Wireless LAN&nbsp;: the <B>cost</B>. Most users just
can't afford to spend the money required to buy a couple of Radio LAN
cards to connect their PCs (without talking of the access point).
<p>
The main cost of a radio LAN is the modem. As this is analog and high
power electronics, it doesn't follows <I>Moore's law</I> (the market
trend that allow you to buy a <I>Cray</I> at the price of a calculator
after a few years) and modems tend to be fairly stable in
price. <I>Frequency Hopping</I> modems tend to be less expensive, but
the <I>802.11</I> specification impose tight constraints on the modem
(timing and filtering), making it high cost. The <B>SWAP</B>
specification, by releasing slightly those constraints, allows for a
much cheaper implementation, but still keeps a good performance.
<p>
The MAC protocol is implemented in software and digital, so doesn't
contribute that much to the final cost of the product (except in term
of development cost). Releasing some hardware constraints prevented
the use of the 802.11, which anyway was much too complex and including
too many features not necessary for the task.
<p>
The main killer application that the HomeRF group envisages is the
integration of digital cordless telephony and the computing word,
allowing the PC to reroute the phone calls in the home or to offer
voice services to the users.
<p>
A new MAC protocol has been designed, much simpler, combining the best
feature of DECT (an ETSI digital cordless phone standard) and IEEE
802.11&nbsp;: a digital cordless phone and ad-hoc data network,
integrated together.
<p>
The voice service is carried over a classical <I>TDMA</I> protocol
(with interference protection, as the band is unlicensed) and reuse
the standard DECT architecture and voice codec. The data part use a
<I>CSMA/CA</I> access mechanism similar to 802.11 (with MAC level
retransmission, fragmentation...) to offer a service very similar to
Ethernet.
<p>
The 1&nbsp;Mb/s Frequency Hopping physical layer allows 6&nbsp;voice
connections and enough data throughput for most users in the Home. The
voice quality should be equivalent to DECT in Europe and much better
than any current digital phone in the US. Data performance should be
slightly lower than 802.11. The MAC protocol has also been designed in
a very flexible way, allowing to develop very cheap handset or data
terminals and high performance multimedia cards for PCs...
<p>
The <B>SWAP</B> specification is an open standard (in fact, more open
than 802.11, because there should be no royalty or patent issues),
quite simple and straightforward. In fact, the combination of voice
and data gets already most marketing people drooling&nbsp;! The only
drawback is that you will have to wait a bit before seeing SWAP
products in your favourite supermarket...
