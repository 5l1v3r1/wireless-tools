<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
The who's who of Wireless LANs under Linux.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<br>
This section contains information about some devices which don't have a
specific entry in one of the previous three sections.

<A NAME="notsup">
<H2>5.1	Not supported (the hall of shame)</H2>
</A>

<B>Netwave AirSurfer plus</B> (in 802.11 mode), <B>BayStack
650</B>&nbsp;: Now that a driver for the BayStack 660 is available, it
should be quite easy to make a driver for those cards, by reusing the
physical layer parts in the AirSurfer plus driver. FreeBsd seems to
have a driver for this device... This product has been discontinued.
<p>
<B>RadioLan</B> has a 10 Mb/s at 5 GHz product, rather very short
range and no Linux drivers. This product has been discontinued.
<p>
<B>WebGear Aviator 900 MHz</B>&nbsp;: connect to the parallel port and
offer cable replacement solution. No functional Linux driver. This
product has been discontinued.
<p>
The <B>IBM Wireless LAN Entry</B> is a discontinued product that may
be sometime found for a very very low price. Unfortunately, there is
no working driver for those and information on the device is
impossible to find. This product has been discontinued.
<p>
Both <B>TI</B> and <B>Broadcom</B> are very unfriendly toward
Linux. They don't release Linux drivers or any information to help
build Linux drivers for their cards despite using Linux drivers
internally and in some products. Open Source drivers for those cards
exist, based on reverse engineering, but because those drivers
probably will never support all features/models of those cards and
because of the overall attitude of those companies, you may want to
avoid those cards.
<p>
<B>Conexant</B> (formerly Intersil) seems to have reverted their
previously pro-Linux approach to ignoring the Linux community (which
did help them so much).

<A NAME="Win32">
<H2>5.2	Win32 drivers</H2>
</A>

Two packages enable the use of Win32 wireless LAN drivers under
Linux&nbsp;:
<UL>
<LI>DriverLoader&nbsp;: http://www.linuxant.com/driverloader/
<LI>NdisWrapper&nbsp;: http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/
</UL>
DriverLoader is commercial, whereas NdisWrapper is GPL. Both seems to
work with a wide range of Win32 drivers and Linux features, for
example both support Broadcom, TI and Intel drivers, and most Wireless
Extensions including Wireless Scanning.
<p>
Some people have strong objections to using Win32 drivers under
Linux. Obviously, such a solution is restricted to the i386
architecture, and make use of a lot of binary code. Also, some less
used Wireless Extensions features are not available in the NDIS
specification (such as link quality, noise level, iwspy, master and
monitor mode).

<H2>5.3	A note on driver licenses</H2>

<I>Donald Becker</I>'s web page alerted me on the <B>license and
copyright</B> issues for networking drivers (see <A
HREF="http://www.scyld.com/expert/modules.html#legal">
http://www.scyld.com/expert/modules.html#legal</A> for details). If
you just plan to use the driver in your Linux PC, there should be no
problem, but if you plan other use of the drivers you should pay
attention to the exact license the driver come in.
<p>
Most drivers are <B>GPL</B>, which prevent their use with non-GPL
kernels (so commercial operating systems can't reuse the code) and
prevent to use portions of the source in non-GPL drivers, except with
the explicit authorisation from the author.
<p>
Some other drivers come with a <B>binary library</B>, which restrict
its potential use (the driver can't be ported to other architectures).
<p>
This may be restrict what you can do with those drivers, but those
people have spend long nights and week ends convincing the hardware
manufacturer to release information, writing and debugging the code,
so please respect their copyrights and decisions.

<H2>5.4	More information on the devices, other Wireless LANs</H2>

You will notice that I don't give too much information on the
different devices. The web page of each <B>vendors</B> usually contain
the full specification of the products they sell.
<p>
They are many more products available than the ones that I've listed
(which are the most common). If your favourite wireless LAN is not
listed above, either there is no driver under Linux that I know of, or
it is an <B>OEM</B> version of one of these (same hardware under a new
brand).
<p>
To have a good picture of all the devices available and their
characteristics, you should redirect your favourite browser to&nbsp;:

<A NAME="other">
<H2>5.5	Other Wireless technologies</H2>
</A>

<H3>5.5.1	Wireless bridges</H3>
<B>Wireless bridges</B> allow to connect different networks via radio,
their goal is to replace a dedicated leased line (T1, for
example). They usually offer longer distance through <B>directional
antennas</B>, and are peer to peer.
<p>
These devices are a totally independent box (like other bridges,
routers or gateways) and not a card to plug in your PC, so have no
interactions with Linux.

<H3>5.5.2	Radio Amateur and AX25 (HAM)</H3>
These devices are quite specific and are described in their own <I>
howto</I>.

<H3>5.5.3	Infrared</H3>

Apart from the remote control stuff, most infrared devices are
<B>IrDA</B> compliant. IrDA defines a full lightweight protocol stack
on top of very cheap and simple hardware, and is optimal for short
ad-hoc transactions (using Obex for example). TCP/IP networking over
IrDA can be done using <B>PPP over IrComm</B>, <B>IrLAN</B> or
<B>IrNET</B> (all of them point-to-point solutions).
<p>
More information on IrDA for Linux is available at :

http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/IrDA/IrDA.html</A>
<p>
There is also some real Wireless LANs using diffuse infrared (no more
peer to peer), but I don't have much information on these.

<H3>5.5.4	BlueTooth</H3>

<B>BlueTooth</B> is a radio standard heavily influenced by IrDA and
USB, and offers the functionality of a wireless USB and serial cable
replacement (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.std.html#mclink"><I>section 8</I></A> for a more
complete description). BlueTooth defines its own protocol stack as
well, and offers the possibility to create long term binding between
devices (attach wirelessly peripherals to a phone or a PDA). TCP/IP
networking over BlueTooth can be done using <B>PPP over RfComm</B> or
<B>PAN</B> (BNEP).
<p>

<H3>5.5.5	Digital mobile phones and other radio WAN</H3>

Again, this is quite different from Wireless LANs. I don't know much
about those devices, except the usual generalitie.
<p>
<B>Digital mobile phones</B> (<I>GSM, TDMA, CDMA, PHS</I>) very often
allow data connections (slow and expensive). Most of them offer a
standard serial interface with an extended AT command set, so can be
configured like a normal modem&nbsp;: PPP over the serial port.
<p>
Some Nokia GSM phones use a kind of half winmodem interface where the
upper layer handling is done by the host. For these phones you need
<B>gnokii</B> (<A
HREF="http://gnokii.org">http://gnokii.org</A>). This package also
provide tools to play with various extra features of the phone (SMS,
address book...).
<p>
Of course, the ultimate geek challenge is to use IrDA (see <A
HREF="#other"><I>section 5.5.3</I></A>) to connect your mobile phone to
your laptop. That's done with PPP over IrComm or gnokii.
<p>
In most cases, <B>Wireless WANs</B> such as <I>CDPD</I> cards, the
<I>Metricom Ricochet</I> and <I>ARDIS</I> should use modem interface
as well.
