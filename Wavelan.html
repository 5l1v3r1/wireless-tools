<A NAME="work">
<H2>My work with the Wavelan</H2>
</A>

The Linux Wavelan drivers are <B>Open Source projects</B> that had
<B>many contributors</B> through their long life. I did contribute to
them since 1996 thanks to <A HREF="http://www.hpl.hp.com">Hewlett
Packard</A> sponsoring my work.
<p>
There was a time, almost now forgotten, when I was working with the
Wavelan and <A HREF="../MobileIP/index.html">Mobile IP</A> with Manuel
Rodr&iacute;guez. But, the usual politics and lack of time prevented
this project to go on. However, the work that I did on the <B>Wavelan
drivers</B> and the <B>Wireless Extensions</B> has found it's way
outside HP, and as the result of this work, I took over the maintaince
of those two projects.
<p>
I'm still officially the maintainer if the ISA and Pcmcia Wavelan
drivers for Linux, even if I've got no more time to maintain it (my
Open Source life is kind of busy). So, if anybody want to volunteer to
take the job (maintaining the drivers), I will be gratefull, meanwhile
I will try to keep the errata list on this page up to date.
<p>
So far, <A HREF="http://www.media.mit.edu/~jseger/wavelan.html">Justin
Seger</A> from MIT *may* have taken over the maintainance of the
Wavelan Linux Pcmcia driver. I wish him good luck and plenty of fun
with it. Other pieces are still up for grabs.

<A NAME="drivers">
<H2>The Wavelan drivers and the Wireless Extensions</H2>
</A>

I was the maintainer of the Wavelan Linux drivers (because I was the
first one put my name in the Linux kernel to say so). Maintainer means
only that I was trying the best I can to solve problems in the drivers
and include other people patches on my page. By the way, if anybody
wants to replace me, just send me an e-mail.
<p>
You will find the <B>ISA driver</B> in recent <A
HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/">kernels</A>, and the <B>Pcmcia
driver</B> in recent <A HREF="http://pcmcia.sourceforge.org/"> Pcmcia
package</A>. <B>Wireless Extension</B> support is built in recent
kernels as well (check your nearest supplier), and now distributions
deliver to you kernels with Wireless Extension <I>enabled</I> !
<p>
There is no specific mailing list, news group or HyperNews server for
the Wavelan drivers or Wireless Extensions (this is because there is
no bugs and no problems, not that I'm too lazy :-).
<p>
The only remaining thing to install on your system is the <A
HREF="Tools.html">Wireless Tool</A> package (to manipulate Wireless
Extensions).

<A NAME="hardware">
<H2>Hardware supported by the driver</H2>
</A>

The <B>Wavelan</B> was a 915 MHz and 2.4 GHz radio LAN product made by
<I>NCR, AT&T</I> and then <I>Lucent</I>, also distributed by
<I>Digital/DEC</I> (under the name <B>RoamAbout DS</B>) and
<I>Hitachi</I>. All those brands were selling basically the same
hardware, which is now discontinued.
<p>
The driver <I>``wavelan''</I> as included in the <B>Linux kernel</B>
has been tested with the following hardware&nbsp;:

<UL>
<LI>Wavelan ISA 915 MHz <I>(full length ISA card)</I>
<LI>Wavelan ISA 915 MHz 2.0 <I>(half length ISA card)</I>
<LI>Wavelan ISA 2.4 GHz <I>(full length ISA card, fixed frequency)</I>
<LI>Wavelan ISA 2.4 GHz 2.0 <I>(half length ISA card, frequency
selectable)</I>
<LI>Above cards with the optional DES encryption feature
</UL>

The driver <I>``wavelan_cs''</I> as included in the <B>Pcmcia
package</B> has been tested with the following hardware&nbsp;:

<UL>
<LI>Wavelan Pcmcia 915 MHz 2.0 <I>(Pcmcia card + separate
modem/antenna block)</I>
<LI>Wavelan Pcmcia 2.4 GHz 2.0 <I>(Pcmcia card + separate
modem/antenna block)</I>
</UL>

If you know of other hardware working with the drivers, <A
HREF="mailto:jt&#064;hpl.hp.com">send me a note</A>...
<p>
On the other hand, the following hardware is <B>NOT supported</B> by
the above drivers&nbsp;:

<UL>
<LI>Wavelan IEEE Pcmcia 2.4 GHz <I>(fully integrated Pcmcia card)</I>
<LI>Wavelan IEEE ISA 2.4 GHz <I>(above card in a Pcmcia/ISA bridge)</I>
<LI>Non-Wavelan wireless LANs <I>(many varieties)</I>
</UL>

I have written a specific page for the <A HREF="Orinoco.html">Wavelan
IEEE MPL/GPL driver</A>, for other wireless LANs and drivers, please
check in my <A HREF="Wireless.html">Linux Wireless LAN Howto</A>.
<p>

<HR width=25%>

<A NAME="patches">
<H2>Latest patches</H2>
</A>

The Linux <B>kernel 2.4.0</B> has the very latest ISA driver,
including SMP support.
<p>
The <B>Pcmcia Package 3.1.24</B> has the very latest Pcmcia driver,
including the latest SMP fixes. On the other hand, the driver included
in kernel 2.4.X is not up to date.
<p>
No pending patches.
<p>

<A NAME="erratas">
<H2>Driver general notes & erratas</H2>
</A>

Life is far from perfect, especially that I don't have much time to
hack the drivers...

<UL>

<LI>The Wavelan drivers contain extensive release notes and
documentation in the source, in `wavelan.p.h' for the ISA driver and
`wavelan_cs.h' for the Pcmcia driver. If you have problems with the
driver, check there first. This also include many compilation options
to play with...

<LI>To try the experimental <B>roaming</B> support of the Pcmcia
driver, use a Pcmcia package later than 3.0.13, and set the wavelan_cs
module option "do_roaming=1" in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts or do "iwconfig
ethX mode managed".

<H2>Acknowledgments</H2>

(here is only a short list - more details may be found in the Wavelan
headers)
<p>
I must thank <A HREF="../MobileIP/index.html">Manuel
Rodr&iacute;guez</A> for being such a fine guy and starting such a
great project. Viva Espa&ntilde;a&nbsp;!
<p>
Thank all the people here (<A HREF="http://www-uk.hpl.hp.com/">HP
Labs Bristol</A>) to bear with me while working on the Wavelan.
<p>
Loeke Brederveld and Nico Valster from Lucent have given me much
needed informations on the Wavelan hardware. Of course, the drivers
wouldn't have been possible without all the people having contributed
code to the drivers, especially Bruce Janson and Anthony D. Joseph the
initial authors or respectively the ISA and the Pcmcia drivers for
Linux.
<p>
The <A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/">Linux community</A> and its
<A HREF="http://www.kernelnotes.org/">gurus</A> have provided us an
operating system beyond our wildest expectations. <A
HREF="http://hyper.stanford.edu/~dhinds/pcmcia/home.html">David
Hinds</A>, <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/">Linus Torvalds</A>,
David S. Miller and <A HREF="http://www.uk.linux.org">Alan
Cox</A> have been really helpful.
<p>
The Linux Wavelan driver users are wonderful !
