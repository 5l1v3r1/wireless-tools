Very important note :
-------------------
	This release of the Wireless Tools is not compatible with Wireless
	Extensions earlier than 9.
	Kernels that support this version of the Wireless Tools are listed
	below. For all kernels before that, please use the version v19 of
	the Wireless Tools.
	If your kernel has the relevant Wireless Extensions but the tools
	refuse to compile, then your kernel headers in /usr/include are
	pointing to the wrong place (very common with Debian).

You need :
--------
	o Compiler and development environment
	o A kernel supporting wireless extensions version 9 or higher
		-> from 2.2.14 onward
		-> from 2.3.24 onward
		Note : CONFIG_NET_RADIO must be enabled
	o A driver supporting wireless extensions
		-> Wavelan isa from kernels above
		-> Wavelan pcmcia from pcmcia 3.1.2 onward
		-> Netwave pcmcia from pcmcia 3.1.2 onward
		-> Wavelan IEEE pcmcia drivers
		-> Proxim RangeLan2/Symphony driver
		-> Patch your favourite driver
	Note : more recent kernels and drivers are likely to support
		more wireless extension features...

Recommended versions :
--------------------
	This are the latest updates of the Wireless Extensions :
	o Kernel (wireless extension definition) :
		-> Kernel 2.2.14 onward
		-> Kernel 2.3.24 onward
	o Drivers with wireless extension support :
		-> Wavelan isa from kernels above
		-> Wavelan pcmcia from pcmcia 3.1.1 onward
		-> Netwave pcmcia from pcmcia 3.1.2 onward
		-> Wavelan IEEE pcmcia GPL driver (wvlan) 1.0.1 onward
		-> Wavelan IEEE pcmcia binary driver (wavelan2) v4.00 onward
		-> Proxim RangeLan2/Symphony driver 1.4.3 onward

Compile wireless tools :
----------------------
	In theory, a "make" should suffice.
	In practice, there is big troubles with the headers. If you
have glibc and kernel 2.2.X headers, that should be all
right. Depending on which version of the kernel headers (might be
different from kernel) and library headers you have, you need to play
with the options buried in iwcommon.h.
	Note : as some internal data structures change from kernel to
kernel, you are advised to not use the precompiled version but to
recompile your own.
	"xwireless" is not currently in a compilable state.

Installation :
------------
	I advise to copy the executable (iwconfig, iwspy and iwpriv)
in /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/sbin. The man pages (iwconfig.8,
iwspy.8 and iwpriv.8) should be copied in /usr/local/man/man8 or
/usr/man/man8.


List of contributors and changelog is in iwcommon.h.
