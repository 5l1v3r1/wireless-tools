.\" DESCRIPTION part

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B iwgetid
is used to find out the NWID, ESSID or AP/Cell Address of the wireless
network that is currently used. The information reported is the same
as the one shown by
.BR iwconfig ", but " iwgetid
is easier to integrate in various scripts.
.br
By default,
.B iwgetid
will print the
.I ESSID
of the device, and if the device doesn't have any ESSID it will print
its
.IR NWID .
.\"
.\" OPTIONS part
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B --scheme
This option disables pretty-printing of the information, only the raw
ESSID (or NWID, or AP Address) is printed. Also, characters that are
not alphanumerics (like space, punctuation and control characters) are
skipped.
.br
The resulting output is a valid Pcmcia scheme identifier (that may be used as an argument of the command
.BR "cardctl scheme" ).
This format is also ideal when using the result of iwgetid as a
variable in
.I Shell
or
.I Perl
scripts.
.TP
.B --ap
Display the MAC address of the Wireless
.I Access Point
or the
.IR Cell .
