man pages (iwconfig.8, iwpriv.8, iwspy.8)
---------
	As far as I know, the man pages are the most complete, up to
date and accurate documentation of the wireless tools, and you really
should read them.
	They can either be copied in a location where the command
"man" will find them, or can be read with the command :
		nroff -man xxx.8 | more
