<BLOCKQUOTE><I>
The who's who of Wireless LANs under Linux.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<br>
The following four sections describes the most common Wireless LAN
products available on the market and their <B>compatibility</B> with
Linux. Except in a few case, you need a <B>driver</B> to interface you
wireless network device to the Linux kernel. The availability of a
driver is as usual your main concern, especially with wireless devices
because fewer people are using such hardware, and the wireless drivers
are complex, so few of them are willing to develop, debug and maintain
such a piece of code.
<p>
I will make a short description of each product and will mainly focus
on the drivers. For each driver, I will list its <I>status</I>
(stable, buggy...), the <I>maintainer</I>, the <I>version</I>, how to
<I>get it</I> and the main <I>features</I>. If you hear about
something new or if you have developed yourself a driver, please
notify me.
<p>
Because of the large number of drivers, it has been divided in
four sections, the first cover really old devices, the second 802.11b
devices, the third one devices faster than 802.11b and the fourth one
other stuff.
<p>
This section list devices predating the IEEE 802.11 standard or based
on the early IEEE 802.11 standards (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.std.html"><I>section 8</I></A>), either Frequency
Hopping or Direct Sequence. Those devices are mostly obsolete and
discontinued, so most of you want to skip directly to the next section
(see <A HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11b.html"><I>section
3</I></A>).

<H3>2.1.1	 The device</H3>

The Wavelan has been around for quite a while now, and this product is
now <B>discontinued</B> (and replaced by the Wavelan IEEE/Orinoco -
see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11b.html#WavelanIEEE"><I>section
3.1</I></A>). The Wavelan is a radio LAN, using the 900 MHz or 2.4 GHz
ISM band (Direct Sequence). It is built by Lucent, formerly AT&amp;T,
formerly NCR, and there is a few OEM version (for example the DEC
RoamAbout DS). The Wavelan comes in two flavours, an ISA card and a
PCMCIA card (plus the access point).
<p>
The Wavelan appears to the PC as a standard network card and
interfaces naturally with the networking stack. The configuration
includes setting the frequency (10 different channels), Network ID (16
bits). Hardware encryption is optional (DES or AES - 64 bits key).
<p>
This product is built around a standard Ethernet controller (that may
be found in some 3Com and Intel Ethernet cards), and the Ethernet
physical layer is replaced by a radio modem. The ISA and Pcmcia cards
share the same basic architecture, have the same modem, but have
different Ethernet Controllers and bus interfaces (the pcmcia has only
one transmit buffer). Because the Wavelan doesn't use a specific radio
MAC (no MAC level retransmissions for example), it uses very
efficiently the bandwidth, but is more sensitive to packet loss and
collisions.
<p>
There is two versions of the modem, a 900 MHz and a 2.4 GHz
version. Revision 2 of the 2.4 GHz modem allows the user to set the
frequency (from a set of predefined channels - the availability of
each channel depend on the regulation). The Wavelan is Direct Sequence
Spread Spectrum (11 chips encoding), using a 2 Mb/s signalling rate
(using effectively 22 MHz of bandwidth) and diversity antennas.

<H3>2.1.2	  The driver</H3>
The ISA driver has also been around for quite a while now in the
kernel and is pretty stable. The last set of modifications were to
solve a few remaining small problems and add Wireless Extensions and
some other features, so the driver is fairly complete now. The only
things remaining to do is the implementation of the roaming protocol
(but it might come, if I'm not too lazy...).
<p>
The Pcmcia driver has caught up with the ISA one to offer the same
level of functionality and reliability. The only difference are the
pcmcia specific functions (auto loading, auto unloading, crude power
saving).
<p>
The latest releases of both drivers (v23) adds SMP support.
<p>
The drivers use the card EEprom to save the configuration changes for
subsequent reboots. Wireless Extensions let you configure the NWID,
the frequency, the sensitivity and the encryption key
(optional). Statistics include the signal quality, signal level, noise
level and the count of packet received with an invalid NWID (see
Wavelan documentation). Private Wireless Extensions include the
setting of the quality threshold.

<H3>2.2.1	 The device</H3>

The Netwave was also a quite common product, but nowadays this product
is <B>discontinued</B>. This is a radio LAN operating in the 2.4 GHz
ISM band. It was built by Netwave Technologies, formerly part of
Xircom. The Netwave is Pcmcia only, and comes in a small form factor
(everything is included on the Pcmcia card !).
<p>
The Netwave use a specific MAC protocol designed for radio (a pre
802.11 protocol, with fancy stuff such as RTS/CTS, virtual carrier
sense and fragmentation). It uses a 9 bits domain (Network ID), the
highest bit of it used for the type of network (set for access point
operation and unset for ad-hoc operation). The Netwave uses also a 16
bits scrambling key (encryption). The Modem offers a 1 Mb/s signalling
rate and frequency hopping (100 ms hop period). On the bad side, the
Netwave has no antenna diversity and a high overhead.
<p>
Note that the Netwave AirSurfer plus is a very different beast (see <A HREF="#AirSurferPlus"><I>below</I></A>).

<H3>2.2.2	 The driver</H3>
The original author of the driver (<I>John</I>) has made a very good
job for debugging it, and his good friend (<I>Dag</I>) has joined the
project, and is fixing the remaining bugs and adding new features. The
driver is quite simple and don't implement yet the full Wireless
Extensions. The driver uses only one transmit buffer, which lower
slightly the performance. The device configuration includes the domain
and the scrambling key which can be set through Wireless Extensions or
as modules parameters (need to be set in
<U>/etc/pcmcia/config.opts</U> - don't forget to restart
<I>cardmgr</I> after a change).
<p>
It seems that the Netwave is quite picky with some pcmcia sockets and
you might need to choose carefully the interrupt (try different ones)
and set the memory speed correctly. In some cases, under high load
(big ftp), the transmission sometime get stuck (I guess that some
interrupt are lost) and the driver has to reset the card (you won't
notice it, it just decreases the performance).

<H3>2.3.1	 The device</H3>

The Netwave AirSurfer plus is the second generation of Netwave card
(this product is now also <B>discontinued</B>), still operate in the
2.4 GHz ISM band and is as well a small Pcmcia card. Netwave
Technologies has now been acquired by BayNetwork, now a part of
Nortel. The BayStack 650 is the new name of the hardware.
<p>
The AirSurfer plus has two modes of operation, compatible with the old
generation of Netwave, or 802.11 compliant. The hardware is based on
an AMD core, and a 1 Mb/s frequency hopping modem.

<H3>2.3.2 The driver</H3>
<I>Jay</I> took the code of the original Netwave
driver and modified it to support the new AirSurfer plus, keeping most
of the features with it. So, you still have the Wireless Extensions,
and modules parameters (in <U>/etc/pcmcia/config.opts</U>).
<p>
The current driver support the AirSurfer plus only in Netwave
compatible mode, and doesn't support the AirSurfer plus with the
802.11 firmware.

<H3>2.4.1	 The device</H3>

The Harris Prism chipset and the AMD AM930 controller are some highly
integrated parts designed to ease the process of building 802.11
products. Harris has done a Pcmcia reference design based on their
chipset and the AMD core, which explain the high number of vendors
building variants of this card (the Harris website has a longer list
than mine ;-). A special mention for YDI (Young Design Inc) which
openly support Linux (see below). Note that all those products are now
<B>discontinued</B> (and replaced with PrismII design - see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11b.html#Prism2"><I>section
3.6</I></A>)...
<p>
The AMD core integrates a generic microcontroller and the hardware
baseband (ASIC) to do the time critical functions of 802.11. AMD has
developed the 802.11 firmware with all the usual 802.11 features (MAC
level ACK, RTS/CTS, Fragmentation...). The Prism chipset is a 2.4 GHz
Direct Sequence modem offering 1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s.  The Prism chipset
can also be extended to supports the new 802.11&nbsp;HR standard, with
5.5 and 11&nbsp;Mb/s bit-rate (either MBOK or CCK modulation).
<p>
The Pcmcia cards are mostly similar from vendor to vendor. Some
vendors offer ISA cards, and the Access Points are where vendors are
making their difference (ZoomTelephonics uses a software AP on a PC,
others have hardware AP).  Each vendor also has to provide the high
level 802.11 in their drivers (authentication, WEP, Roaming...), so
those might be different (not that it does matter much under Linux).
<p>
The BayStack 650 and Netwave AirSurfer plus use the same AMD
controller, but a different physical layer (Frequency Hopping), so are
not compatible with this driver.
<p>
Harris has just become Intersil and released the Prism II chipset,
successor of the PrismI chipset, this time including the MAC
controller (so they won't use any more the AMD part in their reference
design). I'll detail it in the next section (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11b.html#Prism2"><I>section
3.6</I></A>).

<H3>2.4.2 The driver</H3>

<I>Mark</I> and the people at AVS have developed a full 802.11 driver
for the Prism reference design card, and this driver work for the many
other implementations as well. The driver is well written and very
complete&nbsp;: it's currently the only driver where most of the
higher layer 802.11 functionality is implemented. There is also many
initialisation parameters and a tool to configure the card. Because
the 802.11 standard is very complex, not everything is totally
finished and a few features like WEP (RC4 40 bits encryption) are
missing.
<p>
There is currently two branches maintained by <I>Mark</I>, 0.2.X which
is stable and 0.3.X which is experimental.
<p>
<I>Peter</I> (with help from YDI) has created a alternative version of
<I>Mark</I>'s package to add ISA support, fix a few bugs and with
explicit support of cards from YDI. In the long run, those changes
should find their way in <I>Mark</I>'s package...
<p>
<I>Jason</I> has created a version of the 0.3.1 beta driver with
support for the BayStack 660, by porting bits from 0.2.6 (this allow
support for both the BayStack 660 and infrastructure).
<p>
<I>Danny</I> has a patch to make the driver compile and work with
kernel 2.4.X.
<p>
I believe that this driver doesn't support the BayStack 650 and
Netwave AirSurfer plus cards (which don't use the Prism chipset but
Frequency Hopping), but the changes for that might not be that hard to
implement.

<H3>2.5.1	 The device</H3>

Z-Com is based in Taiwan, and the WL2400 family is based on the
classic AMD+Prism design. The family includes the usual ISA and Pcmcia
cards, the Access Point, and also a PC104 version (that's
interesting)...
<p>
Z-Com claims that the WL2400 is firmware upgradable to 802.11, but
I've been told that some old cards have an hardware bug preventing
it. Anyway, the card has all the usual 802.11 features, and the modem
is classsical Direct Sequence at 2.4&nbsp;GHz, supporting 1 and
2&nbsp;Mb/s. Those cards are based on the classical Prism design (AMD
controller + Prism chipset - see <A HREF="#Prism"><I>section
2.4</I></A>), but use a <B>firmware</B> written by Z-Com which is very
different from the regular AMD firmware. This firmware has more
features, is more performant, but has more bugs.
<p>
Z-Com also offers the XI family, which support 5.5. and 11&nbsp;Mb/s
(probably using a Prism II chipset). Those are not supported by this
driver.
<p>
Elsa is a German company selling various hardware component and
started to sell Z-Com cards as Elsa AirLancer MC2. Those cards were
quite popular in Germany.
<p>
Elsa also sell a new AirLancer MC11 which has nothing to do with Z-Com
and is the Wavelan-IEEE (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11b.html#WavelanIEEE"><I>section
3.1</I></A>).

<h3>2.5.2	 The driver</H3>

The driver has been written by the manufacturer, and <I>Matthias</I>
put it on its web site. The driver only contains the object files (no
source) and seem to have been designed for kernel 1.3.X and working in
2.0.X kernels (but, as the driver interfaces in the kernel have
changed since, this driver might not work in 2.2.X). The driver only
work with old firmware revisions (1.2/1.3), and doesn't work with the
802.11 compliant firmware (2.0).
<p>
<I>Matthias</I> seems to now have access to the driver source code and
is investigating compatibility with 2.2.X and new firmware revisions.
<p>
Then, <I>Elsa</I> has released the full source code of this driver
for their card, including configuration utility. <I>Elsa</I> has made
the setup easier and seem to have also fixed a few bugs, because it is
now working with kernel 2.2.X... This version works with 802.11
compliant firmware (2.0).
<p>
More recently, <I>Heiko</I> ported the version of the driver from Elsa
to 2.4.X. This version works with the Pcmcia package (in the Pcmcia
contrib directory) and with <B>firmware 2.0</B>. And then,
<I>Tobias</I> has released a full source code version of this driver
for kernel 2.4.X, likely based on the latest version on
<I>Matthias</I> web page. This version is a patch to the kernel (on
his web page) and works with <B>firmware 1.2/1.3</B>.
<p>
<I>J&ouml;rg</I> took over the maintenance of Elsa driver (for
firmware 2.0) and did a partial rewrite of it. He fixed many bugs
preventing interoperability with more modern 802.11b hardware,
improved compatibility with kernel 2.2.X and 2.4.X, implemented
Wireless Extensions and many other fixes and polishing.
<p>
<I>Arnaldo</I> and <I>Gustavo</I> took over the maintenance of the
driver from <I>Matthias</I> (for firmware 1.2/1.3) and did a partial
rewrite of it. They updated the driver to kernel 2.6.X, added full
support for Wireless Extensions, and this driver is now included in
Kernel 2.6.0-test2. This driver requires Wireless Extension v16 and
will be soon ported to 2.4.23.

<H3>2.6.1	 The device</H3>

The <B>RangeLan2</B> is a classical product using the 2.4 GHz band,
made by Proxim, a small californian company. The products are
certified and sold in approximately 50 countries. The RangeLan2 is
based on Proxim proprietary protocol, <B>OpenAir</B>, that Proxim is
trying to push as an alternative to 802.11. Of course, you will find
many OEM version (like the DEC and AMP versions). It comes as ISA
cards, Pcmcia cards, design-in modules, and access point.
<p>
The RangeLan2 implements a specific MAC protocol designed for radio
(OpenAir, another pre 802.11) implemented on a generic
microcontroller. It uses a 4 bits domain, 4 bits channel and 4 bits
subchannel, and also a station type (primary master, secondary, slave
- this is used for network synchronisation). There is no encryption,
instead it uses a technique called Security ID (which is a simple
password used to derive the network ID). The OpenAir protocol is
heavily based on RTS/CTS, offer a good robustness but some
overhead. It offers as well a modulable contention window size,
contention free access for the master, packet fragmentation and power
saving.
<p>
The Modem uses frequency hopping, and 2 levels of modulations
(2FSK/4FSK)&nbsp;: it runs a 1.6 Mb/s signalling rate for good channel
condition (short to medium distances) and falls back to 0.8 Mb/s
otherwise.
<p>
The <B>Symphony</B> line of product (home networking) offered by
Proxim use the MAC protocol of the RangeLan2 (OpenAir) with a lower
cost radio, and the main difference is the software bundle and the
price. On the other hand, the Proxim <B>RangeLan802</B> line is very
different from OpenAir products, using the 802.11-FH protocol and a
different interface, so the Linux driver won't work with it.
<p>
Recently, Proxim has released its first Symphony products compatible
with the <B>HomeRF SWAP</B> standard. These are also sold as <B>Intel
AnyPoint</B> and <B>Compaq Symphony-HRF</B>. The ISA, PCI and Pcmcia
versions are still offered, and a USB version has been added. Those
products use the same physical layer as the original Symphony, but the
MAC protocol can either operate in OpenAir mode or SWAP mode. The main
advantage of SWAP is the support for cordless telephony.
<p>
Proxim has also various <B>802.11-b</B> products, named
<I>Harmony</I>, <I>Skyline</I> or <I>RangeLan-DS</I> which are PrismII
cards (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11b.html#Prism2"><I>section
3.6</I></A>). Proxim has also released some <B>802.11-a</B> products
which are Atheros cards (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11ag.html#AtherosGPL"><I>section
4.2</I></A>).

<H3>2.6.2	 The driver</H3>
<I>Dave</I> uses the Proxim driver source code to build a library
(distributed as object only), so we should expect a good quality
code. <I>Paul</I> wrote the part to interface with the Linux kernel
and <I>Dave</I> maintains it. He has written as well a small utility
to set the configuration in the driver (through ioctl). The driver
supports the Proxim Rangelan2, the Proxim Symphony, the DEC RoamAbout
FH and the AMP Wireless products. The driver support both ISA PnP and
Pcmcia cards, both with the RangeLan2 and Symphony labels...
<p>
Starting with version 1.7.0, the driver also support the SWAP protocol
and SWAP compliant devices from Proxim, Intel and Compaq (in both
OpenAir and SWAP mode). Both the driver and the configuration tools
have been extended for this support. Also, some primitive support for
USB hardware has been added.
<p>
What I like about this driver is that after all those years,
<I>Dave</I> is still strongly supporting the driver, fixing bugs,
adding new features and adding support for the newer cards. It's
impressive to see such consistency and dedication...

<H3>2.7.1	 The device</H3>

Symbol is one of the other major player for Frequency Hopping devices
in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band and has been selling its Spectrum24 line of
products for ages. Symbol sells mostly to vertical market (in their
bar-code readers, in warehouses, in supermarket), so their products
are not usually found in retailers. The Spectrum24 family include an
Access Point, a ISA card, a Pcmcia card and a Pcmcia card with
micro-AP functionality. However, the main strength of Symbol is their
"all-in-one" products, including a Palm or a WinCE device with a bar
code reader and a 802.11 card, all neatly integrated.
<p>
The Spectrum24 products were designed from the start to be compliant
with the 802.11 standard, way before the standard was eventually
adopted. The first generation (1&nbsp;Mb/s only) was compatible and
interoperable with other 802.11 products (but not compliant), and the
second generation of Spectrum24 (1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s) is officially
802.11 compliant.
<p>
Symbol is also very active in developing Voice over IP solutions for
their wireless LANs, and that's why they are also selling some
Spectrum24 phones. They are using the H.323 codec, compression and
call setup (raw&nbsp;64 kb/s, compressed 10 times) and a 30&nbsp;ms
packet rate (but I fail to see what they have done to overcome
overhead and latency issues at the MAC level).
<p>
The MAC has all the usual features of the 802.11 standard, like MAC
level retransmission, RTS/CTS, fragmentation, auto bit-rate selection,
power saving and roaming. A nice feature of the MAC is the support of
the micro-AP functionality, which allows to turn a PC into an Access
Point (I would like more vendors to start doing that). However, their
products don't seem to support ad-hoc mode.
<p>
The physical layer is Frequency Hopping supporting 1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s,
with 100&nbsp;mW or 500&nbsp;mW output power and 100&nbsp;ms dwell
size.

<H3>2.7.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Lee</I> has written the driver as a student project for Symbol, so
with active help from Symbol. He plans to continue supporting it, and
Symbol may get more active in distributing the driver.
<p>
The driver is designed for the Pcmcia card (LA2400 and micro-AP
version), and the new 2&nbsp;Mb/s version of the card. It is possible
to use older cards (1&nbsp;Mb/s) by updating the firmware for 802.11
compliance, and to use ISA card by configuring properly the Pcmcia
package (those cards use a regular ISA to Pcmcia bridge).
<p>
Despite being beta, the driver is stable, well written and supports
most features of the card (like micro-AP, shared memory access...).

<H3>2.8.1	 The device</H3>

The Arlan was a radio LAN, built by Aironet, using the 900MHz or
2.4GHz ISM band (Direct Sequence). This product has been
<B>discontinued</B> and replaced by the 4500 series (see <A
HREF="#Arlan802"><I>section 3.14</I></A>). The Arlan comes in 3
flavour, an ISA (655), an MCA (670) and a pcmcia (690) card (plus the
access point). Later, they renamed the ISA card IC2200 and the Pcmcia
card PC2200 (still the same hardware).
<p>
The configuration include setting the frequency and Network ID (24
bits ?). The MAC protocol is implemented on a generic
microcontroler. There is two versions of the modem, a 900 MHz and a
2.4 GHz version. Both use Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum. The 900 MHz
modem allow signalling rate up to 860 kb/s (fall back to 215 kb/s) and
12 channels. The 2.4 GHz version allow signalling rate up to 2 Mb/s
(fall back to 1 Mb/s) and 5 channels.

<H3>2.8.2	 The driver</H3>
<I>Russell Nelson</I> told me a while ago that he was trying to
convince Aironet to release the specifications of the Arlan to develop
a Linux driver. <I>Cullen Jennings</I> started the development of a
point to point driver, <I>Elmer Joandi</I> rewrote some parts and
added a lot of features to be compatible with the Access Point,
released the whole under GPL, and here is the result.
<p>
The driver support only the ISA version of the card (655 or IC
2200). The driver have been fully tested and optimised by <I>Elmer
Joandi</I>, includes a complete /proc interface and should be soon
included in the kernel.

<H3>2.9.1	 The device</H3>

The Raylink is a IEEE 802.11 FH device build by Raytheon for the 2.4
GHz ISM band. Raytheon build only a Pcmcia card and an Access
Point. I've been told that some version of the BreezeCom BreezeNet Pro
Pcmcia card was an OEM version of the Raylink.
<p>
You are more likely to buy the Raylink as a WebGear product, either as
Aviator2.4 or Aviator2.4 pro (which have nothing in common with their
old Aviator 900 MHz line). The Aviator2.4 and Aviator2.4 pro are in
fact the same product as the Raylink, the Aviator2.4 driver comes
pre-configured in ad-hoc mode and offer only the Pcmcia card, whereas
the Aviator2.4 pro driver comes preconfigured in managed mode and
offer both the Pcmcia card and the Access Point (translation seems
also to be different in each driver). Of course, it is possible to
change the mode in the driver and all these products are fully
interoperable. WebGear also offers a ISA to Pcmcia bridge to install
the Pcmcia card in desktops.
<p>
Lately, WebGear has stop selling those cards, but recently BUSlink has
started selling them again (same card, different sticker).
<p>
The Raylink delivers all the features expected from a 802.11 compliant
device, with ad-hoc networking, access point operation, authentication
and roaming. The MAC protocol is as defined in 802.11&nbsp;: CSMA/CA with
MAC level retransmissions. Configuration includes mostly the ESSID
(network name).
<p>
The modem is 2.4 GHz Frequency Hopping, with 1 Mb/s and 2 Mb/s bit
rate, and includes antenna diversity.

<h3>2.9.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Corey</I> has implemented a very complete driver supporting most of
the feature of the hardware and some 802.11 functionality (it should
be able to talk to some 802.11 nodes). There is an exhaustive list of
configuration parameters, a /proc interface for more parameters, and a
tool to dump 802.11 frames. Good work&nbsp;!
<p>
The new version of the driver adds Alpha support, authentication, and
compatibility with the Windows driver. SMP is slowly being
tested. I've added to the driver quite complete support for Wireless
Extension (changing parameters still doesn't work right - therefore
wireless.opts do not work).
<p>
The driver has been developed for the Raytheon Raylink and has also
been successfully tested with the WebGear Aviator2.4 and the BUSlink.
<p>
I recently improved the support for <B>Wireless Extensions</B>. It is
now possible to configure the card before the card is brought up (for
example in the various configuration files). However, it is still not
possible to change most parameters at run time (but they can always be
read).

<H3>2.10.1	 The device</H3>

The HomeFree was one of the first affordable home networking
solution. It is sold by Diamond Multimedia and designed by a small
company, Alation. The card comes in ISA, PCI and Pcmcia form factor.
<p>
To reduce the cost, Alation has used the same solution as IrDA&nbsp;: to
implement the MAC protocol in the driver instead of on the card. In
fact, they are using a IrDA chip as the baseband, and instead of
connecting it to an Ir transceiver, they use a classical 1 Mb/s
Frequency Hopping modem at 2.4 GHz.
<p>
This solution save the cost of an embedded microcontroller on the card
and allow to build a cheaper product (and to develop it faster). The
downside is that building the MAC protocol in the driver tend to
increase the protocol overhead (the MAC need more time to react to
events - this reduce throughput and increase latency) and use more
resources on the host (processor cycles and memory). In fact, this is
an effect similar to win-modems and win-printers. Also, because there
is a lot more code (which is more tightly integrated in the OS and
performance critical), the driver is more difficult to port to other
OSes (and that's why the driver below doesn't implement the HomeFree
MAC protocol).
<p>
Personally, I'm not a fan of this design, but it seems to do the job
cheaply.

<H3>2.10.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Pavel</I> has developed a very simple and nice driver for the
HomeFree. The development was sponsored by PODA s.r.o., a Czech
company, which allowed Pavel to release the driver as GPL after some
time...
<p>
This driver is both very different from a standard network driver (as
the other driver I present on this page) and very different from the
HomeFree Windows driver. This driver is a straight tty interface to
the hardware (like a serial port), and doesn't implement any MAC
protocol. Therefore, it can't be interfaced directly to the standard
Linux networking stack, and is not compatible with the Windows driver.
<p>
Therefore, to use this driver, a MAC protocol of some sort is needed
(to arbitrate access to the medium, multiplex connection and ensure
reliability). <I>Pavel</I> recommend to use either some Ham protocols
such as Scarab, or to use the Linux-IrDA stack. You can also develop
you own application directly on top of this half duplex interface
(most serial applications will assume full duplex).
<p>
The advantage of that is that those protocols are very lightweight, so
usually perform much better (in term of raw throughput) than the
original HomeFree protocol, and even better than some other WLAN
products. However, those protocol (Scarab, IrDA) are not designed for
the specifics of the 2.4 GHz band and don't include all the goodies
found in 802.11. For example, IrDA allow only two nodes to be
exchanging data at one time (only one IrLAP connection active) and
deal poorly with multi nodes network. I also don't know how they deal
with co-located networks and radio interferences.
<p>
However, the most critical missing feature is regulations
compliance. The 802.11 protocol include some feature to insure
compliance with all the various regulations in the 802.11 band (such
as Frequency Hopping - usage of Radio Frequency tend to be highly <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.modem.html#ism">regulated</A>). As the driver of
<I>Pavel</I> doesn't include all these features, this driver <B>may
not be legal</B> in your country (note&nbsp;: this doesn't apply to the
Windows driver, the Windows driver is legal because Diamond has
certified it with the FCC and ETSI), and usage of this driver may
bring you big troubles (same as setting up a illegal transmitter in
the FM band). So, if you care about legislation, I advise you to check
with <I>Pavel</I> about your specific case, otherwise use at your own
risks...

<H3>2.11.1	 The device</H3>

The BreezeNet is a Radio LAN using the 2.4 GHz ISM band (Frequency
Hopping). The earlier versions of the Pcmcia cards were OEM of other
vendors, the old one was an OEM version of the <B>Netwave</B>, then it
was an OEM version of the <B>Raylink</B>, but their latest pro.11
Pcmcia card is <B>100&nbsp;% BreezeCom</B> (the one with two little
antenna sticks). BreezeCom has also a 802.11-b line, called DS.11, and
the Pcmcia card is a <B>No Wires Needed</B> card.
<p>
In term of protocol and modem, the Pcmcia cards are very similar to
the other BreezeCom products (see <A HREF="#BreezeNetOther"><I>section
2.11</I></A>). The first two Pcmcia cards were limited in term of
bit-rate (only 1&nbsp;Mb/s), and have lower transmit power.

<H3>2.11.2	 The driver</H3>

The driver presented here apply only to the latest pro.11 Pcmcia
card. For the old Pcmcia card (not pro), you may use the netwave_cs
driver (see <A HREF="#Netwave"><I>section 2.2</I></A>). For the first
pro.11 Pcmcia card, you may use the ray_cs driver (see <A
HREF="#Raylink"><I>section 2.9</I></A>). For the DS.11 card (802.11-b
compliant), you may use the swallow_cs driver (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.drivers.802.11b.html#Swallow"><I>section
3.17</I></A>).
<p>
BreezeCom has also release a Linux driver for their latest pro.11
card. I've been informed of the existence of this driver since October
99, and many people have been using it since by getting it directly
from BreezeCom, but BreezeCom did release this driver to the wide
public only 6 months later. Let's not complain, because the driver
contains the full source and is now GPL, so it was worth the wait !
<p>
The driver was written by <I>Christian Olrog</I>, an employee of
Ericsson, based on the original Windows driver source, and it seems
that the maintenance has been taken over by <I>Alfred Cohen</I> of
BreezeCom. The source code looks very nice and complete, with only a
few features missing. One interesting feature is that the driver can
show the signal strength for Access Points in the area. However, the
initial configuration could be simpler...
<p>
The driver has been in use by many Linux users since its original
development and there doesn't seem to have been much complains about
it, which is good ;-)
<p>
The original version of the driver, 1.0, is only for Linux kernel
2.2.X. There is a beta version of the driver for Linux kernel 2.4.X.

<H3>2.12.1	 The device</H3>

The BreezeNet is a Radio LAN using the 2.4 GHz ISM band (Frequency
Hopping). It is built by BreezeCom, a small company from Israel, and
some OEM version might be available. The BreezeNet doesn't connect to
any of the usual PC bus but instead uses an Ethernet network card to
interface to the host computer, and so require no driver to work (they
have also some real access points). For the Pcmcia hardware, see
above.
<p>
There is three versions of the BreezeNet, the old one, somewhat
Netwave compatible, then the first pro.11 version (flash upgradable to
802.11) and the new pro.11 version, which is 802.11 compliant, so with
all the usual MAC features expected from 802.11 devices. In all cases
the modem includes Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (20&nbsp;ms hop
period), a 3&nbsp;Mb/s signalling rate (fall back to 2 and
1&nbsp;Mb/s) and antenna diversity. Note that the 3&nbsp;Mb/s bit rate
is not 802.11 compliant.
<p>
BreezeCom now offers a DS.11 series of adapters which is 802.11-b
compliant, with usual 802.11-b features (and up to 11&nbsp;Mb/s) and still
using the Ethernet interface.
<p>
In 2001, BreezeCom and Floware Wireless Systems merged together to
form Alvarion. The new combined company seems to put less emphasis on
wireless LANs and more on point-to-point links and wireless
distributions systems, even though the old BreezeNet product lines are
still available.

<H3>2.12.2	 The driver</H3>

No driver is needed, this product use an Ethernet connection. You need
to have an dedicated Ethernet 10baseT card configured under Linux to
plug it into. For the device configuration and statistics, unless
someone write the necessary tools for Linux, I guess that you must
return to DOS/Windows.
