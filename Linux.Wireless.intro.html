Linux &amp; Wireless LANs : Un*x, with no string attached...
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<br>
This document will explore the magical world of <B>Wireless LANs</B>
and <B>Linux</B>. Wireless LAN is not a very widespread and well known
technology, even in the Linux world, so we will try to gather here
most of the available information. Despite the fact that it is very
similar to common networking technologies, it is significantly
different to justify this specific document covering the subject.

<H2>1	What is a Wireless LAN&nbsp;?</H2>
It's a <B>networking</B> technology allowing the connection of
computers without any wires and cables (apart from the mains), mostly
using <B>radio</B> technology (and sometime <B>infrared</B>). It's
called LAN (Local Area Network) because the range targeted is small
(within an office, a building, a store, a small campus, a
house...). This technology is slowly growing (I should say maturing),
and despite a general lack of interest, Linux is able to take
advantage of some of the wireless networks available.

<H2>2	Content of this document</H2>
My first task is to talk a bit about the different Wireless LANs
options under Linux. What the <B>products</B> on the market are, their
compatibility with Linux and where to find the necessary bits and
pieces to make them work. This should help you to make your mind on
the product of your dreams.
<p>
Once you've picked a Wireless LAN, you will have to live with it. The
next chapter go through the main <B>differences</B> of Wireless LAN
compared to other networking technologies. This includes the main
steps of the installation and usage considerations.
<p>
Then, we will have a nice overview of the Wireless Extensions. The
<B>Wireless Extensions</B> is a new standard interface to configure
Wireless LAN devices and get wireless specific statistics from
them. Of course, this is a Linux exclusivity !
<p>
At this point, you will find a long and dense section, talking mostly
of the different <B>technologies</B> used in Wireless LANs and other
boring related stuff. It is quite safe to skip that one.

<H2>3	Target and Assumptions</H2>

The main goal of this document is to reduce the traffic of unanswered
questions related to wireless in the Linux newsgroups and mailing
lists (and in my mailbox). After that, you should have no more
arguments for asking foolish questions around (but I know you will do
anyway).
<p>
I hope that this document will help people to make the most of their
Wireless LAN under a competent operating system and understand what is
in the box. If I could convince people to give it a try, it would make
me happy.
<p>
This document act mostly as a complement to the exhaustive
documentation existing for Linux. Because of that, I might not explain
every details of everything and target already quite knowledgeable
people. Don't worry, there is a section on how to improve your culture
at the beginning of the <A HREF="Linux.Wireless.usage.html"><I>section
3</I></A>.

<H2>4	Legal stuff</H2>
Strange world where everybody has to protect himself from sharks,
lawyers and crazy people :
<p>
Any information in this document is purely fictious and any
resemblance to real hardware, software or driver is purely
coincidental...
<p>
I mean, if because you read this document your hardware burn, you get
fired from your job or anything else bad happen, I'm not responsible,
it can't be my fault, so please use your own brain. Writing this kind
of documents is not part of my job at HP, so I don't expect them to
claim any responsibility for its content.
<p>
Any brand mentioned in this document is trademark of its respective
owner. For example Linux is a trademark of Linus Torvalds.
<p>
Then, this is my document, written by me (Jean Tourrilhes), therefore
I own its copyright. So don't remove my name (and copyright notice)
and pretend that you wrote it yourself. In matter of copy,
distribution and modification, you should ask me politely and use
common sense.

<H2>5	This document</H2>

This document is only available in the format that are convenient to
me (acrobat/pdf, html). It might be updated in the future (if I feel
like it and if I have some time). I guess that it is pretty safe to
assume that it will still be available for the time to come at these
<B>web</B> addresses :

Comments about my english and my style will be answered in french
