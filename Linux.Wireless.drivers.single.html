The who's who of Wireless LANs under Linux.
</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<br>
This section describes the most common Wireless LAN products available
on the market and their <B>compatibility</B> with Linux. I will make a
short description of each product and will mainly focus on the
drivers.
<p>
Except in a few case, you need a <B>driver</B> to interface you
wireless network device to the Linux kernel. The availability of a
driver is as usual your main concern, especially with wireless devices
because few people are using such hardware, so few of them are
willing to develop, debug and maintain such a piece of code.
<p>
For each driver, I will list its <I>status</I> (stable, buggy...), the
<I>maintainer</I>, the <I>version</I>, how to <I>get it</I> and the
main <I>features</I>. If you hear about something new or if you have
developed yourself a driver, please notify me.

<H3>1.1	 The device</H3>

The Wavelan has been around for quite a while now, and this product is
now <B>discontinued</B> (and replaced by the Wavelan IEEE/Orinoco -
see <A HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 2</I></A>). The Wavelan is a
radio LAN, using the 900 MHz or 2.4 GHz ISM band (Direct Sequence). It
is built by Lucent, formerly AT&amp;T, formerly NCR, and there is a
few OEM version (for example the DEC RoamAbout DS). The Wavelan comes
in two flavours, an ISA card and a PCMCIA card (plus the access
point).
<p>
The Wavelan appears to the PC as a standard network card and
interfaces naturally with the networking stack. The configuration
includes setting the frequency (10 different channels), Network ID (16
bits). Hardware encryption is optional (DES or AES - 64 bits key).
<p>
This product is built around a standard Ethernet controller (that may
be found in some 3Com and Intel Ethernet cards), and the Ethernet
physical layer is replaced by a radio modem. The ISA and Pcmcia cards
share the same basic architecture, have the same modem, but have
different Ethernet Controllers and bus interfaces (the pcmcia has only
one transmit buffer). Because the Wavelan doesn't use a specific radio
MAC (no MAC level retransmissions for example), it uses very
efficiently the bandwidth, but is more sensitive to packet loss and
collisions.
<p>
There is two versions of the modem, a 900 MHz and a 2.4 GHz
version. Revision 2 of the 2.4 GHz modem allows the user to set the
frequency (from a set of predefined channels - the availability of
each channel depend on the regulation). The Wavelan is Direct Sequence
Spread Spectrum (11 chips encoding), using a 2 Mb/s signalling rate
(using effectively 22 MHz of bandwidth) and diversity antennas.

<H3>1.2	  The driver</H3>
The ISA driver has also been around for quite a while now in the
kernel and is pretty stable. The last set of modifications were to
solve a few remaining small problems and add Wireless Extensions and
some other features, so the driver is fairly complete now. The only
things remaining to do is the implementation of the roaming protocol
(but it might come, if I'm not too lazy...).
<p>
The Pcmcia driver has caught up with the ISA one to offer the same
level of functionality and reliability. The only difference are the
pcmcia specific functions (auto loading, auto unloading, crude power
saving).
<p>
The latest releases of both drivers (v23) adds SMP support.
<p>
The drivers use the card EEprom to save the configuration changes for
subsequent reboots. Wireless Extensions let you configure the NWID,
the frequency, the sensitivity and the encryption key
(optional). Statistics include the signal quality, signal level, noise
level and the count of packet received with an invalid NWID (see
Wavelan documentation). Private Wireless Extensions include the
setting of the quality threshold.

<H3>2.1	 The device</H3>

Even if it uses the same name, the <B>Wavelan IEEE</B> product is
completely different from the old Wavelan, and totally incompatible in
term of protocol and hardware interface. It is still built by Lucent,
and it still operate in the 2.4 GHz ISM band (Direct Sequence), but
the new hardware fully support the IEEE 802.11 protocol (and 802.11-b
for the more recent versions) and is no longer based on a Ethernet MAC
chip. There is only a Pcmcia version (the ISA version uses a ISA to
Pcmcia bridge) and the different access points. Recently, Lucent has
added a USB adapter and mini PCI version of the card for laptop (this
one is based on a PCI-Pcmcia bridge).
<p>

To confuse the issue, Lucent has renamed the Wavelan IEEE as
<B>Orinoco</B> (Wavelan was better IMHO), and this division was part
of Lucent spin-off into a new company called
<B>Agere</B>. <B>Avaya</B> (another Lucent spin-off) is also selling
the Orinoco. Enterasys is also selling the Wavelan IEEE as
<B>RoamAbout 802</B> (a company formerly known as Cabletron, which was
the former DEC networking division). Elsa is selling it in Europe as
<B>AirLancer 11</B> (on the other hand, the 2 Mb/s version is quite
different). In Japan (and maybe also in Europe), Melco is selling it
as <B>Buffalo WLI-PCM-L11</B>. Lately, more vendors have been joining
the club, such as HP (<B>HP 802.11b Wireless LAN</B>), IBM (<B>IBM
High Rate Wireless LAN</B>), Dell (<B>Dell TrueMobile 1150</B> - on
the other hand, the 1100 is an <A HREF="#Arlan802"><I>Aironet</I></A>
card), Compaq (<B>Compaq WL 110, WL 210 and WL 215</B> - the WL100 and
WL200 are <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>PrismII</I></A> based), 1stWave
(<B>1stWave PC-Card</B>) and ARtem (<B>ARtem ComCard</B>).  The Apple
<B>Airport</B> is also derived from the Wavelan IEEE (see <A
HREF="#Airport"><I>section 6</I></A>).
<p>
The Wavelan IEEE saga never ends. <B>Proxim</B> bought the card and
access point business of Agere (Agere kept the chipset and radio
part), so now the same Orinoco cards are sold by Proxim under the name
<B>Orinoco Classic</B> or <B>Orinoco World</B> (841X - with the big
square antenna and using the same Agere Hermes chipset). In a bold
marketing move, Proxim renamed all it's other lines of wireless cards
as Orinoco, however those cards are not based on the Agere chipset but
on <B>Atheros</B> chipset (846X, 847X and 848X). The <B>Orinoco
11b</B> (842X - 802.11b only with a short antenna) are based on the
Agere HermesII chipset, which is different from the old chipset (and
therefore not compatible with the usual Orinoco drivers). So, if the
Proxim Orinoco card doesn't have a big square antenna and do support
802.11a or 802.11g, you can be sure it's not a <B>true Orinoco</B>.
<p>
The Wavelan IEEE appears to the PC as a standard network card and
interfaces naturally with the networking stack. The configuration
includes only setting the network name (ESSID), the rest is automatic
(finding the equivalent BSSID and channel). As usual for Lucent, the
documentation and website are rich.
<p>
The Lucent Wavelan IEEE is based on the Lucent Hermes chipset. As with
all IEEE 802.11 products, the Hermes offer a fully featured MAC
protocol, including MAC level acknowledgement (good news for all of us
having dealt with the old Wavelan card), optional RTS/CTS,
fragmentation, automatic rate selection, roaming. This seems
exhaustive, but is mandatory for IEEE 802.11 compliance. Different
version of the card include different level of security (bronze is
basic, silver is with WEP (RC4-40 bits) and gold is with proprietary
128 bit encryption.
<p>
The MAC support both Managed and <B>Ad-Hoc modes</B>. However, the
initial firmware for those cards did support only a non-compliant
Ad-Hoc mode (called Ad-Hoc demo mode - which interoperate with most
PrismII cards). In order to gain WiFi compliance, Lucent added in
recent firmware (6.06 and greater) a second Ad-Hoc mode which is fully
802.11 compliant (called Peer to Peer mode or IBSS Ad-Hoc mode - and
which interoperate with Aironet cards). Of course, the two Ad-Hoc
modes are not interoperable.
<p>
The 2.4 GHz modem is an enhanced version of the previous generation,
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (11 chips encoding), using both 1 and
2 Mb/s signalling rate (using effectively 22 MHz of bandwidth) and 5.5
and 11 Mb/s in second generation cards, diversity antennas and with 13
different frequencies (depending on the regulations).
<p>
Initially, the Wavelan was only offering 1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s bit rates
(basic IEEE 802.11 DS standard). For a while, Lucent was also selling
a "turbo" version of the card, which was adding 5 and 10&nbsp;Mb/s
bit-rates for shorter range using Lucent proprietary modulations (so,
not compatible with 802.11-b).
<p>
Later, Lucent introduced the second generation of the Wavelan IEEE,
still based on the same Hermes chipset, which is much cheaper and
fully compliant with the new <B>802.11-b</B> standard, supporting 1,
2, 5.5 and 11&nbsp;Mb/s bit-rate (compatible with other 11&nbsp;Mb/s
products).
<p>
All Wavelan IEEE cards do not offer the exact same set of features,
because Lucent keep changing the <B>firmware</B>. From firmware
<B>1.00</B> to <B>4.52</B>, Lucent was mostly adding features
(encryption, power saving) and keeping it backward compatible, but
firmware <B>6.04</B> and later created a major
incompatibility. Firmware <B>6.06</B> and later implement a fully
802.11 compliant IBSS Ad-Hoc mode (on top of the Ad-Hoc demo
mode). Firmware <B>6.04</B> dropped Fragmentation Threshold setting in
favor of microwave oven robustness (an automatic fragmentation
scheme). Firmware <B>6.16</B> did fix a few bugs with the IBSS Ad-Hoc
mode (security, ESSID="any").
<p>
Agere has recently released a new <B>HermesII</B> chipset, derived
from the venerable Hermes chipset. The most notable improvements are a
higher integration (smaller & cheaper), a PCI interface with DMA
support and a USB interface. The chip interface and firmware is not
compatible with the old Hermes chipset, requiring specific driver
support for HermesII. To my knowledge, this chipset is only used in
the Proxim 842X cards.


<H3>2.2	  The driver</H3>

<I>Andreas Neuhaus</I> is no longer working to improve this driver,
therefore it's now discontinued in favor of the new Orinoco driver
(see <A HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section 3</I></A>). The driver is based on
Lucent source code, which is a cut down version of their full
driver. So, it lacks all the part about handling natively 802.11
frames and Lucent proprietary API, and initially it lacked some of the
more fancy features of Lucent's driver, but <I>Andreas</I> is adding
them slowly. Of course, the driver support all version of the card
(bronze, silver, gold - basic, turbo, turbo 11 Mb/s) and is fully
interoperable with Access Points and Windows nodes.
<p>
<I>Andreas</I> has done a very good job into providing features like
Wireless Extensions (I must admit that I did help him quite a bit ;-)
and many configuration parameters (station name, channel, mtu
size). The new version adds Power management and encryption setting,
change of the operating mode via Wireless Extensions, promiscuous and
multicast support...
<p>
<I>Andreas</I> has done a lot of debugging of the driver and it seems
now much more stable. Lastly, the ISA to Pcmcia and PCI to Pcmcia
bridges may be a source troubles under Linux. The latest version of
the driver fixes SMP support, multi-cards configuration, improve
wireless.opts support, add IBSS Ad-Hoc mode support and support
properly and sanely the various firmware releases.
<p>
<I>Harald Roelle</I> has developped a patch for this driver in order
to fully support the PPC architecture. This patch mostly contain some
bit order fixes. This patch should help other architecture with
endianess issues. His patch was eventually integrated (with major
changes) by <I>David Hinds</I> in version 1.0.6 of the driver. I added
firmware detection support in 1.0.6 to properly handle all the various
firmware releases and their variations (in particular the two Ad-Hoc
modes), and fixed the remaining SMP bugs.
<p>
The driver does not support the USB and Mini-PCI version of the
Wavelan.
<p>
Nowadays, <I>Anton Blanchard</I> is the official maintainer of the
driver, with the help of <I>David Gibson</I>. <I>David</I> has done a
complete rewrite of the driver (see <A HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section
3</I></A>), so this driver won't be maintained anymore...
<p>
<I>Moustafa</I> has released a version of this driver with scanning
support.
<p>
<B>Note</B> that Lucent has also released a binary library driver (see
<A HREF="#WavelanIEEEbin"><I>section 4</I></A>) which is maybe more
solid and performant than the driver of <I>Andreas</I> but lack
complete support for Wireless Extensions.

<H3>3.1	 The device</H3>

As explained in various sections, Lucent Wavelan-IEEE/Orinoco devices
(see <A HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 2</I></A>), Intersil PrismII
devices (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>) and Symbol High
Rate devices (see <A HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 18</I></A>) are
basically using the <B>same MAC controller</B>. This driver attempt to
support all those devices, which are described in details in their own
sections.
<p>
However, even though those devices use the same MAC controller and the
same driver, those devices are not the same. Each vendor has its own
<B>firmware</B>, so the set of features of those cards vary. Some
differences are visible to the user (for example 128 bits key
support), some are more related to performance and robustness tuning
of the MAC.
<p>
Moreover, those devices don't use the same <B>radio modem</B> (mostly
Lucent or Intersil) and same antennas. For PrismII cards, even the
actual layout of the radio components on the card can make a huge
difference. This will mostly translate into difference of
<B>coverage</B> between the various cards (range and resistance to
interference). The range between some cards may vary by a factor 2 in
some conditions.

<H3>3.2	  The driver</H3>

<I>Anton Blanchard</I> and <I>David Gibson</I> became official
maintainers of the wvlan_cs driver (see <A
HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 2</I></A>) in the end of
2000. <I>David</I> was not very happy about the state of wvlan_cs.
<p>
The HCF (the low level library provided by Lucent) hadn't been
maintained since the initial release of the driver and was quite
difficult to read and understand. While the higher layer of the driver
had gone a long way and were robust and fully featured, the HCF was a
mess and the cause of many problems (TxTimeout, driver
corruption/crashes and else).
<p>
Rather than put up with that, David looked deeply in the low level of
the <B>wlan-ng</B> driver from Mark (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section
11</I></A>) and the FreeBSD driver and wrote a totally new driver
combining a new low level core and the high level features of
wvlan_cs. The end result was a driver much more readable, robust and
well behaved than wvlan_cs. In the process, David added support for
PrismII cards. Then, I fixed a few Wireless Extensions bugs, added
some support for Symbol cards, and we pushed the driver in the
kernel. The driver was initially named <B>dldwd_cs</B> and was renamed
<B>orinoco_cs</B> at this point. Later on, <I>David Hinds</I> backported this
driver to the Pcmcia package for users of earlier kernels.
<p>
The main goal of the driver is to support <B>Wavelan IEEE/Orinoco
cards</B> and OEM. The driver support all the firmwares and features
of those cards properly and fully (Ad-Hoc demo mode, IBSS mode,
bit-rate, encryption keys...), and support all the features available
in wvlan_cs (except module parameters) with less bugs.
<p>
<I>Ben</I> has added Airport support to this driver (see <A
HREF="#Airport"><I>section 6</I></A>), and the support of those cards
is similar to Orinoco cards (i.e. most features supported properly).
<p>
Starting in release v0.6d, the support of <B>Symbol cards</B> and OEM
is complete, at least for firmware 1.5 and 1.7. Bit rate, mode of
operation (managed, ad-hoc IBSS and ad-hoc demo), encryption and power
management are fully working. The release v0.8 added full support for
later Symbol firmware 2.00 and 2.20. On firmware 2.20 and later, Power
Management is disabled. Version of the driver from <B>v0.10 to v0.12b
don't work</B> properly with Symbol cards due to a bug, so avoid those
releases. <B>Symbol CF cards</B> are very different and supported in
their own driver (see <A HREF="#SpectrumCF"><I>section 21</I></A>).
<p>
The support of <B>PrismII cards</B> and clones is in progress. More
debugging and testing need to be done, but the driver can set most
features to some degree (Ad-Hoc demo mode, IBSS mode, bit-rate,
encryption keys have been seen to work). It seems the upgrading
firmware fixes problems related to encryption. However, the
<I>wlan-ng</I> and <I>HostAP</I> drivers still have more features and
are more tested...
<p>
Starting in release v0.8, the orinoco driver collection also support
<B>PLX adapters</B> that are sold with some PrismII cards (via the
<I>orinoco_plx</I> driver). Those adapters are not real Pcmcia
adapters and the card looks to the system like a PCI card. The driver
also support Pcmcia cards in regular ISA to Pcmcia or PCI to Pcmcia
adapters, as long the <B>Pcmcia adapter</B> is recognised and
configured properly by the Pcmcia package (which might be tricky).
<p>
Starting in release v0.11a, the orinoco driver collection also support
<B>PCI cards</B> (all of them being PrismII cards - via the
<I>orinoco_pci</I> driver). The standard driver does not support the
various <B>USB</B> versions of the cards. There is various kind of
<B>MiniPCI</B> implementation of the card, the driver support some of
them (Pcmcia based - Lucent ; PCI based - PrismII) but not most (USB
based - PrismII).
<p>
The latest version (v0.13b) seems to have fix most of the hardware
reset problems of previous versions and seems to have fixed problems
with Symbol firmwares. There are <B>many patches</B> not yet
integrated in the base driver, such as the patch for Wireless Scanning
and Wireless Events support and the patch to provide Monitor mode,
most of those patches are listed on my web page (Orinoco release
notes).

<H3>4.1	  The device</H3>

This is the same device as the previous entry (<A
HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 2</I></A>).

<H3>4.2	  The driver</H3>

<I>Lucent</I> has decided to not put all its eggs in the same basket
and developed a bold strategy for the support of the Wavelan IEEE
under Linux. Not only they have released some source code to allow the
source driver mentioned above, but they have as well contracted
<I>Dean</I> to release a driver based on a binary library. This gives
Linux users the choice, a GPL full source driver to hack with and a
stable full featured binary driver (the official term from Lucent is
``Linux Driver Source/Library'').
<p>
<I>Dean</I> has written the code interfacing between Linux and the
library, and has put together a nice package easy to install and with
documentation. As expected, the binary driver is probably more stable
and than the full source driver mentioned above, with a slightly
different set of feature, and offers all the features of Lucent Window
drivers, plus a nice integration with Linux. This driver supports both
the basic version of the card and the "turbo". The major drawback is
the binary core, preventing the use on other architectures (PPC,
Arm...).
<p>
Now, the driver is supported by Lucent, and they keep adding in it the
same features they add to the Windows drivers (such as microwave oven
robustness). Their also have added support for the IBSS Ad-Hoc mode
(see discussion above). The latest version adds support for 2.4 kernel
and many common Wireless Extensions. Note that Enterasys/Cabletron is
also distributing a slightly modified version of this driver (usually
an older one).
<p>
<I>Moustafa</I> has released a version of this driver with scanning
support.
<p>
Recently, <I>Agere</I> has released a new version of this driver which
is fully Open Source. This version has support for the <B>HermesII</B>
chipset found in the Proxim Orinoco 842X cards. It has also improved
wireless extension support.

<H3>5.1	 The device</H3>

The Orinoco-USB is of course related to other
<B>Wavelan-IEEE/Orinoco</B> devices (see <A
HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 2</I></A>). As most first generation
USB designs, it is really a standard Orinoco Pcmcia card plugged into
a <B>Cypress EZ-USB</B> USB-Pcmcia bridge. Such a setup of course
brings some performance degradation due to USB high latency. The
Orinoco card inside the device has the same exact features as other
Orinoco Pcmcia cards and is 802.11b compliant.
<p>
Lucent, Agere and Proxim are directly selling this <B>Orinoco</B>
device. HP/Compaq sells it as <B>WL215</B> (standalone) and
<B>W200</B> (multiport option for Compaq laptops). Other vendors such
as Melco are also selling this hardware. One of the particularity of
this hardware is that the USB-Pcmcia bridge doesn't contain a
firmware, so the driver need to upload the firmware at power up. On
the other hand, the Pcmcia card behind the USB-Pcmcia bridge already
contains its own firmware.
<p>
Note that most USB 802.11b cards are based on either the Intersil
PrismII chipset (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>) or the
Atmel chipset (see <A HREF="#Atmel"><I>section 30</I></A>), and are
quite different from this hardware.

<H3>5.2	  The driver</H3>

Manuel has managed to reverse engineer the Orinoco USB hardware and is
providing a modified version of the Orinoco driver for Orinoco USB
adapters. This driver only support <B>Orinoco USB</B> hardware, and
not other USB cards. Because it is based on the Orinoco driver (see <A
HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section 3</I></A>), this driver offer the same
extended feature set, such as Wireless Extension support.
<p>
The big difference with the standard Orinoco driver is <B>firmware
uploading</B>. You will need to extract the firmware for the
USB-Pcmcia bridge from the Windows driver using the tools provided on
the driver web page. The firmware uploading support in Linux needed
for this driver is currently being finalised, so check the latest
driver documentation. On the other hand, the driver offer no support
for updating the firmware in the Pcmcia card.

<H3>6.1	 The device</H3>

The Apple <B>AirPort</B> is in fact the Lucent <B>Wavelan IEEE</B>
repackaged, so has the same characteristic as the Wavelan (see <A
HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 2</I></A>). All Airport hardware is
802.11-b compliant (second generation of Wavelan IEEE) and support 11
Mb/s, and Apple seem to offer only the version with 40 bit encryption.
<p>
The AirPort card for the most Apple hardware is the OEM version of the
Wavelan IEEE, but it uses a specific slot in those computers and the
antennas are pre-integrated in the host. Most recent Apple machines
offer this interface (iBook, PowerBook 2000 (aka Pismo), AGP G4s,
recent iMacs (DV/SE)...). Note that this interface is <B>not Pcmcia
compatible</B> even is the connector is the same, so this card can't
be used in the normal PC-Card slot of other laptops. This is why this
card work only in specific Apple hardware slot and only with a
specific driver.
<p>
The Access Point (the famous flying saucer) is similar in
functionality to the Lucent RG-1000 Residential Gateway, and is fully
interoperable with other 802.11-b hardware.

<H3>6.2	  The driver</H3>

The <B>first version</B> of the Airport driver was done by <I>Benjamin
Herrenschmidt</I> by porting the driver of <I>Andreas Neuhaus</I> (see
<A HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 2</I></A>) to support the Apple
Aiport card. He has basically integrated the specific PPC patch of
<I>Harald Roelle</I>, thrown away all the Pcmcia code and replaced it
with the specific Apple initialisation code.
<p>
Apart from that, the driver is basically the same, with the same
features and same bug ;-)
<p>
The <B>second version</B> of the driver was also done by <I>Benjamin
Herrenschmidt</I> and is just a wrapper on top of the driver of
<I>David Gibson</I> (see <A HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section 3</I></A>), and
was integrated in version 0.05 (kernel 2.4.5). This is a much cleaner
solution, because both driver share the same source, so the feature
set is identical and all improvements and bug fixes of the Orinoco
driver are automatically in the Airport driver and vice-versa.

<H3>7.1	 The device</H3>

The Netwave was also a quite common product, but nowadays this product
is <B>discontinued</B>. This is a radio LAN operating in the 2.4 GHz
ISM band. It was built by Netwave Technologies, formerly part of
Xircom. The Netwave is Pcmcia only, and comes in a small form factor
(everything is included on the Pcmcia card !).
<p>
The Netwave use a specific MAC protocol designed for radio (a pre
802.11 protocol, with fancy stuff such as RTS/CTS, virtual carrier
sense and fragmentation). It uses a 9 bits domain (Network ID), the
highest bit of it used for the type of network (set for access point
operation and unset for ad-hoc operation). The Netwave uses also a 16
bits scrambling key (encryption). The Modem offers a 1 Mb/s signalling
rate and frequency hopping (100 ms hop period). On the bad side, the
Netwave has no antenna diversity and a high overhead.
<p>
Note that the Netwave AirSurfer plus is a very different beast (see <A HREF="#AirSurferPlus"><I>below</I></A>).

<H3>7.2	 The driver</H3>
The original author of the driver (<I>John</I>) has made a very good
job for debugging it, and his good friend (<I>Dag</I>) has joined the
project, and is fixing the remaining bugs and adding new features. The
driver is quite simple and don't implement yet the full Wireless
Extensions. The driver uses only one transmit buffer, which lower
slightly the performance. The device configuration includes the domain
and the scrambling key which can be set through Wireless Extensions or
as modules parameters (need to be set in
<U>/etc/pcmcia/config.opts</U> - don't forget to restart
<I>cardmgr</I> after a change).
<p>
It seems that the Netwave is quite picky with some pcmcia sockets and
you might need to choose carefully the interrupt (try different ones)
and set the memory speed correctly. In some cases, under high load
(big ftp), the transmission sometime get stuck (I guess that some
interrupt are lost) and the driver has to reset the card (you won't
notice it, it just decreases the performance).

<H3>8.1	 The device</H3>

The Netwave AirSurfer plus is the second generation of Netwave card
(this product is now also <B>discontinued</B>), still operate in the
2.4 GHz ISM band and is as well a small Pcmcia card. Netwave
Technologies has now been acquired by BayNetwork, now a part of
Nortel. The BayStack 650 is the new name of the hardware.
<p>
The AirSurfer plus has two modes of operation, compatible with the old
generation of Netwave, or 802.11 compliant. The hardware is based on
an AMD core, and a 1 Mb/s frequency hopping modem.

<H3>8.2 The driver</H3>
<I>Jay</I> took the code of the original Netwave
driver and modified it to support the new AirSurfer plus, keeping most
of the features with it. So, you still have the Wireless Extensions,
and modules parameters (in <U>/etc/pcmcia/config.opts</U>).
<p>
The current driver support the AirSurfer plus only in Netwave
compatible mode, and doesn't support the AirSurfer plus with the
802.11 firmware.

</TABLE>

<H3>9.1	 The device</H3>

The Harris Prism chipset and the AMD AM930 controller are some highly
integrated parts designed to ease the process of building 802.11
products. Harris has done a Pcmcia reference design based on their
chipset and the AMD core, which explain the high number of vendors
building variants of this card (the Harris website has a longer list
than mine ;-). A special mention for YDI (Young Design Inc) which
openly support Linux (see below). Note that all those products are now
<B>discontinued</B> (and replaced with PrismII design)...
<p>
The AMD core integrates a generic microcontroller and the hardware
baseband (ASIC) to do the time critical functions of 802.11. AMD has
developed the 802.11 firmware with all the usual 802.11 features (MAC
level ACK, RTS/CTS, Fragmentation...). The Prism chipset is a 2.4 GHz
Direct Sequence modem offering 1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s.  The Prism chipset
can also be extended to supports the new 802.11&nbsp;HR standard, with
5.5 and 11&nbsp;Mb/s bit-rate (either MBOK or CCK modulation).
<p>
The Pcmcia cards are mostly similar from vendor to vendor. Some
vendors offer ISA cards, and the Access Points are where vendors are
making their difference (ZoomTelephonics uses a software AP on a PC,
others have hardware AP).  Each vendor also has to provide the high
level 802.11 in their drivers (authentication, WEP, Roaming...), so
those might be different (not that it does matter much under Linux).
<p>
The BayStack 650 and Netwave AirSurfer plus use the same AMD
controller, but a different physical layer (Frequency Hopping), so are
not compatible with this driver.
<p>
Harris has just become Intersil and released the Prism II chipset,
successor of the PrismI chipset, this time including the MAC
controller (so they won't use any more the AMD part in their reference
design). I'll detail it in the next section (see <A
HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>).

<H3>9.2 The driver</H3>

<I>Mark</I> and the people at AVS have developed a full 802.11 driver
for the Prism reference design card, and this driver work for the many
other implementations as well. The driver is well written and very
complete&nbsp;: it's currently the only driver where most of the
higher layer 802.11 functionality is implemented. There is also many
initialisation parameters and a tool to configure the card. Because
the 802.11 standard is very complex, not everything is totally
finished and a few features like WEP (RC4 40 bits encryption) are
missing.
<p>
There is currently two branches maintained by <I>Mark</I>, 0.2.X which
is stable and 0.3.X which is experimental.
<p>
<I>Peter</I> (with help from YDI) has created a alternative version of
<I>Mark</I>'s package to add ISA support, fix a few bugs and with
explicit support of cards from YDI. In the long run, those changes
should find their way in <I>Mark</I>'s package...
<p>
<I>Jason</I> has created a version of the 0.3.1 beta driver with
support for the BayStack 660, by porting bits from 0.2.6 (this allow
support for both the BayStack 660 and infrastructure).
<p>
<I>Danny</I> has a patch to make the driver compile and work with
kernel 2.4.X.
<p>
I believe that this driver doesn't support the BayStack 650 and
Netwave AirSurfer plus cards (which don't use the Prism chipset but
Frequency Hopping), but the changes for that might not be that hard to
implement.

<H3>10.1	 The device</H3>

Z-Com is based in Taiwan, and the WL2400 family is based on the
classic AMD+Prism design. The family includes the usual ISA and Pcmcia
cards, the Access Point, and also a PC104 version (that's
interesting)...
<p>
Z-Com claims that the WL2400 is firmware upgradable to 802.11, but
I've been told that some old cards have an hardware bug preventing
it. Anyway, the card has all the usual 802.11 features, and the modem
is classsical Direct Sequence at 2.4&nbsp;GHz, supporting 1 and
2&nbsp;Mb/s. Those cards are based on the classical Prism design (AMD
controller + Prism chipset - see <A HREF="#Prism"><I>section
9</I></A>), but use a <B>firmware</B> written by Z-Com which is very
different from the regular AMD firmware. This firmware has more
features, is more performant, but has more bugs.
<p>
Z-Com also offers the XI family, which support 5.5. and 11&nbsp;Mb/s
(probably using a Prism II chipset). Those are not supported by this
driver.
<p>
Elsa is a German company selling various hardware component and
started to sell Z-Com cards as Elsa AirLancer MC2. Those cards were
quite popular in Germany.
<p>
Elsa also sell a new AirLancer MC11 which has nothing to do with Z-Com
and is the Wavelan-IEEE (see <A HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section
2</I></A>).

<h3>10.2	 The driver</H3>

The driver has been written by the manufacturer, and <I>Matthias</I>
put it on its web site. The driver only contains the object files (no
source) and seem to have been designed for kernel 1.3.X and working in
2.0.X kernels (but, as the driver interfaces in the kernel have
changed since, this driver might not work in 2.2.X). The driver only
work with old firmware revisions (1.2/1.3), and doesn't work with the
802.11 compliant firmware (2.0).
<p>
<I>Matthias</I> seems to now have access to the driver source code and
is investigating compatibility with 2.2.X and new firmware revisions.
<p>
Then, <I>Elsa</I> has released the full source code of this driver
for their card, including configuration utility. <I>Elsa</I> has made
the setup easier and seem to have also fixed a few bugs, because it is
now working with kernel 2.2.X... This version works with 802.11
compliant firmware (2.0).
<p>
More recently, <I>Heiko</I> ported the version of the driver from Elsa
to 2.4.X. This version works with the Pcmcia package (in the Pcmcia
contrib directory) and with <B>firmware 2.0</B>. And then,
<I>Tobias</I> has released a full source code version of this driver
for kernel 2.4.X, likely based on the latest version on
<I>Matthias</I> web page. This version is a patch to the kernel (on
his web page) and works with <B>firmware 1.2/1.3</B>.
<p>
<I>J&ouml;rg</I> took over the maintenance of Elsa driver (for
firmware 2.0) and did a partial rewrite of it. He fixed many bugs
preventing interoperability with more modern 802.11b hardware,
improved compatibility with kernel 2.2.X and 2.4.X, implemented
Wireless Extensions and many other fixes and polishing.
<p>
<I>Arnaldo</I> and <I>Gustavo</I> took over the maintenance of the
driver from <I>Matthias</I> (for firmware 1.2/1.3) and did a partial
rewrite of it. They updated the driver to kernel 2.6.X, added full
support for Wireless Extensions, and this driver is now included in
Kernel 2.6.0-test2. This driver requires Wireless Extension v16 and
will be soon ported to 2.4.23.

<H3>11.1	 The device</H3>

The PrismII chipset is the successor of the PrismI chipset, described
in the previous section (see <A HREF="#Prism"><I>section 9</I></A>),
and is build by Intersil (formerly Harris). Intersil offer this
chipset and some reference design to various OEM, allowing them to
build various 802.11-b products (cards or integrated in their own
products). I expect that all the people that were formerly using the
PrismI chipset will switch sooner or later to the PrismII.
<p>
The first manufacturers to offer PrismII cards were <B>Samsung</B> and
<B>Compaq</B> (WL100, WL200, rumored to be a rebadged Samsung card),
with a Pcmcia card, a PCI card and an Access Point. Other Prism
vendors like <B>ZoomAir</B>, <B>Nokia</B> and <B>GemTek</B> did
release later their own version of the PrismII cards, as well as
<B>Proxim</B> (RangeLAN DS, Harmony 802.11b...). Some big networking
vendors like <B>D-Link</B>, <B>LinkSys</B>, <B>NetGear</B> and
<B>SMC</B> were also quick to jump on this new opportunity for them,
as well as many smaller vendors like <B>AddTron</B>, <B>Ambicom</B>,
<B>Teletronics</B>, <B>Ampwave</B> and many other that I can't
list... The rule of thumb is that if your card is not listed in
another section of the Howto, it could be a PrismII card (or not, see
below).
<p>
Some notable exceptions which are <B>not</B> PrismII cards : the
<B>Compaq WL 110, WL 210 and WL 215 cards</B> (which are
<I>Orinoco</I> cards), the <B>D-Link 650H</B> (which is a
<I>Symbol</I> card), most <B>D-Link/LinkSys/SMC USB</B> cards (which
are <I>Atmel</I> cards), the <B>SMC 2632W-v2</B> (which is an
<I>Atmel</I> card), all <B>22&nbsp;Mb/s</B> cards such as the
<B>D-Link 650+/520+</B> (based on the <I>TI chipset</I>), all
<B>CardBus</B> cards such as the <B>new D-Link 650</B> (which is an
<I>ADMtek</I> card), all <B>802.11a</B> cards (which are
<I>Atheros</I> or <I>Intersil PrismDuette</I> cards) and all
<B>802.11g</B> cards (which are <I>Broadcom</I>, <I>Atheros</I> or
<I>Intersil PrismGT</I> cards). In fact, so many vendors seem to be
moving away from the PrismII chipset (usually without warning and
without changing the model name) and there is so many changes
happening that it's impossible to keep track of who is using what.
<p>
Please note that everything that <B>looks like a PrismII card</B> may
not be a PrismII card, and many people are quite confused about
that. The cards described in this section use both a Intersil PrismII
chipset and an Intersil firmware. Other vendors, such as Lucent (see
<A HREF="#WavelanIEEE"><I>section 2</I></A>), Aironet (see <A
HREF="#Arlan802"><I>section 23</I></A>), Symbol (see <A
HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 18</I></A>) and Atmel (see <A
HREF="#Atmel"><I>section 30</I></A>) use part of the PrismII chipset
but with their own firmware and therefore are <B>not compatible</B>
(even if they sometime use the same device identification as PrismII
cards and sort of work with PrismII drivers).
<p>
Most PrismII vendors offer regular <I>Pcmcia cards</I> for
laptops. For desktop machines, the situation is a bit more messy, some
vendors offer standard <I>PCI-Pcmcia cards</I> (where you can slot the
Pcmcia card), dedicated <I>PLX cards</I> (that look like a regular
PCI-Pcmcia bridge but is not) or some <I>fully integrated PCI
cards</I> (Prism2.5). Some vendors also offer <I>USB adapters</I>
(beware, some of them are <I>Amtel</I> cards, and all of them have
performance issues). Lastly, some laptop include <I>MiniPCI cards</I>
that may be either integrated PCI cards or USB adapters.
<p>
Like the initial PrismI design, the PrismII is fully compatible with
802.11 and include a 2.4 GHz Direct Sequence modem, with all the usual
features (Roaming, WEP...).
<p>
The main differences between the PrismI and PrismII chipset are a
higher integration, a higher performance modem and the replacement of
the AMD controller with Intersil own design. The higher integration (5
chips instead of 8) allows to reduce the price and the size of the
product, and to simplify the integration. The new physical layer
(modem) has a better performance (but a lower transmit power),
increasing range, speed and battery life, and is fully compliant with
the 802.11-b standard (5.5 and 11 Mb/s). Finally, the new MAC
controller handle most of the 802.11 functionality (instead of leaving
it to the driver), which simplify driver development and help
performance on slow devices (palmtop, embedded design).
<p>
The <B>Prism2.5</B> and <B>Prism3</B> chipsets are evolution of the
PrismII chipset, offering even higher integration, lower cost and
backward compatibility. With respect to the driver, these 3 chipset
look the same, and therefore driver supporting PrismII hardware will
also support Prism2.5 and Prism3 hardware.
<p>
Note that the PrismII <B>firmwares</B> are usually not of the highest
quality and quite inconsistent from one release to another, both on
the cards and on the Access Points, and you may have to try a few of
them before finding the one that work for you. For example, encryption
and IBSS ad-hoc mode seems to be working only in the latest firmwares
(0.8.3 and later), and multicast is not working at all. It also
usually takes a bit of time to get the workaround for the latest
firmwares in the various Linux drivers. Latest firmware seem to have
fixed most problems and have added the feature missing from earlier
firmwares.
<p>
A few words about <B>Ad-Hoc modes</B>&nbsp;: like for Orinoco card,
the firmware support two ad-hoc mode, the Ad-Hoc demo mode (not
802.11-b compliant, but reported to be Orinoco Ad-Hoc demo mode
compatible) and the IBSS Ad-Hoc mode (802.11-b compliant). The IBSS
Ad-Hoc mode is only available in firmwares 0.8.3 and later.

<H3>11.2 The driver</H3>

Who was more qualified to write this driver than <I>Mark</I>, from
AVS, who already wrote the driver for the PrimsI cards&nbsp;? In fact,
Intersil did partner with <I>Mark</I> to get this driver written for
us&nbsp;!
<p>
As usual with <I>Mark</I>, the driver is really complete and well
written. It is currently only in beta stage, and <I>Mark</I> told me
that he needs to add more documentation and debug some more
features. The driver support both Pcmcia and PCI cards. This driver is
compatible with Linux bridging software, includes a generic 802.11
interface, exposing the full 802.11 MIB to user space, and include
hooks to build an Access Point. The driver also come with a
configuration tools, an utility to dump 802.11 frames and a daemon
responding to 802.11 events.
<p>
The release 0.1.10 fixes a number of long standing problems and
include a number of patches and features that were floating around on
the mailing lists. This version supports properly WEP encryption and
Ad-Hoc mode. Note that the driver supports only <B>IBSS ad-hoc</B>
mode (0.1.10 and later) and only for recent firmwares, whereas most
cards also support the old ad-hoc demo mode.
<p>
The driver supports <B>Pcmcia, PLX and PCI cards</B>. The
PLX card allow to add a Pcmcia card in a PCI slot, but does not
support any of the Pcmcia functionality, so is not supported through
the Pcmcia package but directly by the driver. PCI support is for
fully integrated PCI cards or MiniPCI cards. <I>Mark</I> has also
added <B>USB support</B> (only for Intersil USB cards, not Atmel
cards).
<p>
<I>Reyk</I> has developped a patch that adds basic Wireless Extension
support to the driver, and that was included in version 0.1.13. He
needs help for testing and improving it.
<p>
Since then, <I>Mark</I> is concentrating on a Intersil 802.11a driver
(not Atheros) and has transferred the maintenance of the driver to
<I>Solomon</I> (a new AVS employee). <I>Solomon</I> is making the
driver SMP compliant, cleaning it up and keeping up with the new
firmwares from Intersil.
<p>
<I>Mark</I> is also selling a Wireless Development kit and an Access
Point, based on a PPC platform and this driver.

<H3>13.1	 The device</H3>

This is the same device as the previous entry (<A
HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>).
<p>
One of the most interesting feature of the standard PrismII firmware
is that it can allow the host to act as an Access Point (<B>HostAP
mode</B>). This allow to turn a regular PC with a Prism2 cards into an
Access Point, allowing other nodes to connect to it. In HostAP mode,
the card does only the critical part of the Access Point (sending
beacons) and simply pass all the 802.11 management frames to the
driver (which does 802.11 management itself).
<p>
Note that this HostAP mode doesn't exist or is not documented for
other cards (non-PrismII firmwares). Also, it is possible to load
special firmware in PrismII card which allows the card to perform the
full Access Point functionality by itself (tertiary firmware).

<H3>13.2 The driver</H3>

<I>Jouni</I> has recently written this totally new driver for PrismII
card. It is well written, it was probably inspired by the various
other driver floating around and is much more simpler than the
linux-wlan-ng driver (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>).
<p>
The driver has complete support for the various feature of the PrismII
card (WEP, IBSS Ad-Hoc mode, scanning...), very complete support for
Wireless Extensions and offer various extra information in a
<U>/proc</U> directory, making already an excellent choice for a
standard wireless client.
<p>
What set this driver apart from the other driver is its support for
HostAP mode. In this mode, the driver act as an Access Point on the
air and does all the 802.11 management necessary. In this mode, the
driver also allows bridging through the regular Ethernet bridge driver
of Linux. This explain why this driver is use by most Linux
Access-Point projects.
<p>
<I>Jouni</I> continues to refine his driver and has added PLX and PCI
cards support, monitor mode, MAC address based access list and WDS
support (to allow Access Point to communicate with each other).
<p>
In other words : impressive work...

<H3>14.1	 The device</H3>

The Samsung <B>MagicLAN</B> is one of the various products based on
the Intersil PrismII chipset (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section
11</I></A> for full details). It's a fully featured wireless lan
compliant with 802.11-b. The Compaq products are rumored to be the
Samsung one, with a new sticker...

<H3>14.2 The driver</H3>

Samsung has released their own version of a PrismII driver for their
card. The driver seems complete and well written, the new releases
fixes more bugs and I had report of people successfully using it (with
Samsung cards and even some LinkSys and D-Link cards).
<p>
The main difference with the PrismII driver of <I>Mark</I> (see <A
HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>) is that the Samsung driver is
based on a binary library (so, only available on x86 platforms), offer
encryption and Ad-Hoc mode and offer some support for Wireless
Extensions.

<H3>15.1	 The device</H3>

The Prism Indigo, Prism GT and Prism Duette are the third generation
of chipsets from Intersil, logical follower of the second generation
PrismII and Prism3 chipsets (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section
11</I></A>). The <B>Prism Indigo</B> was released first, and support
802.11a (5&nbsp;GHz band). The <B>Prism GT</B> support 802.11g (and
802.11b - 2.4&nbsp;GHz band). The <B>Prism Duette</B> support both
802.11a and 802.11g (in both the 2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz band).
<p>
Because of the limitations of the previous PrismII design, those new
chipsets feature a totally new design, much cleaner and much more
efficient, and doesn't share much in common with the earlier Prism
designs, but is more likely to be related to the NWN MAC that Intersil
acquired (see <A HREF="#Swallow"><I>section 27</I></A>).
<p>
The chipset is highly integrated (2 or 3 chip solutions). Like
previous Prism chipsets, most of the 802.11 management is handed in
firmware. However, the bus interface is now PCI DMA only (less CPU
overhead, faster). The MAC support the usual 802.11 features, and
hardware WEP and AES encryption, and the firmware fully act as an
Access Point. The Radio implement the OFDM modulation necessary to
support 802.11a and 802.11g.
<p>
There doesn't seem to be any products using the Prism Indigo chipset
(most card offering 802.11a are based on Atheros chipset - see <A
HREF="#AtherosGPL"><I>section 37</I></A>), and I don't expect to see
any in the future. A few of the usual Intersil partners, such as
Netgear and SMC, have started selling 802.11g cards based on the Prism
GT and Prism Duette chipsets (so far, 802.11g cards are either
Broadcom, Intersil or Atheros).

<H3>15.2 The driver</H3>

This driver was written and released as GPL by Intersil itself&nbsp;!
This is a much stronger commitment to OpenSource than some other
vendors have made.
<p>
<I>Luis</I>, <I>Frederik</I> and <I>Sebastian</I> are taking care of
this driver after the initial release from Intersil and helping people
with the driver. They are fixing a few bugs and improving
compatibility with the various kernels and configurations. The project
is currently in the early phase of organising itself, however the
driver is already fully usable.
<p>
The driver provide its own configuration tools, but seems to also
support basic Wireless Extensions. The driver can act as an Access
Point through a FirmwareAP mode (all the AP management is handled by
the firmware).
<p>
The driver is going through some heavy reorganisation. Support for
kernel 2.6 and more Wireless Extension is being added, and the setup
procedure is being simplified.

<H3>16.1	 The device</H3>

The <B>RangeLan2</B> is a classical product using the 2.4 GHz band,
made by Proxim, a small californian company. The products are
certified and sold in approximately 50 countries. The RangeLan2 is
based on Proxim proprietary protocol, <B>OpenAir</B>, that Proxim is
trying to push as an alternative to 802.11. Of course, you will find
many OEM version (like the DEC and AMP versions). It comes as ISA
cards, Pcmcia cards, design-in modules, and access point.
<p>
The RangeLan2 implements a specific MAC protocol designed for radio
(OpenAir, another pre 802.11) implemented on a generic
microcontroller. It uses a 4 bits domain, 4 bits channel and 4 bits
subchannel, and also a station type (primary master, secondary, slave
- this is used for network synchronisation). There is no encryption,
instead it uses a technique called Security ID (which is a simple
password used to derive the network ID). The OpenAir protocol is
heavily based on RTS/CTS, offer a good robustness but some
overhead. It offers as well a modulable contention window size,
contention free access for the master, packet fragmentation and power
saving.
<p>
The Modem uses frequency hopping, and 2 levels of modulations
(2FSK/4FSK)&nbsp;: it runs a 1.6 Mb/s signalling rate for good channel
condition (short to medium distances) and falls back to 0.8 Mb/s
otherwise.
<p>
The <B>Symphony</B> line of product (home networking) offered by
Proxim use the MAC protocol of the RangeLan2 (OpenAir) with a lower
cost radio, and the main difference is the software bundle and the
price. On the other hand, the Proxim <B>RangeLan802</B> line is very
different from OpenAir products, using the 802.11-FH protocol and a
different interface, so the Linux driver won't work with it.
<p>
Recently, Proxim has released its first Symphony products compatible
with the <B>HomeRF SWAP</B> standard. These are also sold as <B>Intel
AnyPoint</B> and <B>Compaq Symphony-HRF</B>. The ISA, PCI and Pcmcia
versions are still offered, and a USB version has been added. Those
products use the same physical layer as the original Symphony, but the
MAC protocol can either operate in OpenAir mode or SWAP mode. The main
advantage of SWAP is the support for cordless telephony.
<p>
Proxim has also various <B>802.11-b</B> products, named
<I>Harmony</I>, <I>Skyline</I> or <I>RangeLan-DS</I> which are PrismII
cards (see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>). Proxim has also
released some <B>802.11-a</B> products which are Atheros cards (see
<A HREF="#AtherosGPL"><I>section 37</I></A>).

<H3>16.2	 The driver</H3>
<I>Dave</I> uses the Proxim driver source code to build a library
(distributed as object only), so we should expect a good quality
code. <I>Paul</I> wrote the part to interface with the Linux kernel
and <I>Dave</I> maintains it. He has written as well a small utility
to set the configuration in the driver (through ioctl). The driver
supports the Proxim Rangelan2, the Proxim Symphony, the DEC RoamAbout
FH and the AMP Wireless products. The driver support both ISA PnP and
Pcmcia cards, both with the RangeLan2 and Symphony labels...
<p>
Starting with version 1.7.0, the driver also support the SWAP protocol
and SWAP compliant devices from Proxim, Intel and Compaq (in both
OpenAir and SWAP mode). Both the driver and the configuration tools
have been extended for this support. Also, some primitive support for
USB hardware has been added.
<p>
What I like about this driver is that after all those years,
<I>Dave</I> is still strongly supporting the driver, fixing bugs,
adding new features and adding support for the newer cards. It's
impressive to see such consistency and dedication...

<H3>17.1	 The device</H3>

Symbol is one of the other major player for Frequency Hopping devices
in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz band and has been selling its Spectrum24 line of
products for ages. Symbol sells mostly to vertical market (in their
bar-code readers, in warehouses, in supermarket), so their products
are not usually found in retailers. The Spectrum24 family include an
Access Point, a ISA card, a Pcmcia card and a Pcmcia card with
micro-AP functionality. However, the main strength of Symbol is their
"all-in-one" products, including a Palm or a WinCE device with a bar
code reader and a 802.11 card, all neatly integrated.
<p>
The Spectrum24 products were designed from the start to be compliant
with the 802.11 standard, way before the standard was eventually
adopted. The first generation (1&nbsp;Mb/s only) was compatible and
interoperable with other 802.11 products (but not compliant), and the
second generation of Spectrum24 (1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s) is officially
802.11 compliant.
<p>
Symbol is also very active in developing Voice over IP solutions for
their wireless LANs, and that's why they are also selling some
Spectrum24 phones. They are using the H.323 codec, compression and
call setup (raw&nbsp;64 kb/s, compressed 10 times) and a 30&nbsp;ms
packet rate (but I fail to see what they have done to overcome
overhead and latency issues at the MAC level).
<p>
The MAC has all the usual features of the 802.11 standard, like MAC
level retransmission, RTS/CTS, fragmentation, auto bit-rate selection,
power saving and roaming. A nice feature of the MAC is the support of
the micro-AP functionality, which allows to turn a PC into an Access
Point (I would like more vendors to start doing that). However, their
products don't seem to support ad-hoc mode.
<p>
The physical layer is Frequency Hopping supporting 1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s,
with 100&nbsp;mW or 500&nbsp;mW output power and 100&nbsp;ms dwell
size.

<H3>17.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Lee</I> has written the driver as a student project for Symbol, so
with active help from Symbol. He plans to continue supporting it, and
Symbol may get more active in distributing the driver.
<p>
The driver is designed for the Pcmcia card (LA2400 and micro-AP
version), and the new 2&nbsp;Mb/s version of the card. It is possible
to use older cards (1&nbsp;Mb/s) by updating the firmware for 802.11
compliance, and to use ISA card by configuring properly the Pcmcia
package (those cards use a regular ISA to Pcmcia bridge).
<p>
Despite being beta, the driver is stable, well written and supports
most features of the card (like micro-AP, shared memory access...).

<H3>18.1	 The device</H3>

Despite being a long time proponent of Frequency Hopping, Symbol
couldn't ignore the success of 802.11-b. After a strategic agreement
with Intel, Symbol is back with a complete line of 802.11-b products,
that are called <B>Spectrum24 High Rate</B> (to better confuse them
with their old FH products). Symbol still sell mostly to vertical
markets through VAR, but both 3Com and Intel are repackaging Symbol
cards, as <B>Intel PRO/Wireless</B> and <B>3Com AirConnect</B>.  The
Symbol CF card is also sold by <B>Socket Communications</B>.
<p>
Of course, there are exceptions&nbsp;: the <B>Symbol/Socket CF</B>
cards (Compact Flash) and the Intel <B>2011B</B> card don't have a
built in firmware and require a specific version of the driver (called
CF). On the other hand, the <B>3Com/Intel PCI cards</B> are <A
HREF="#Prism2"><I>PrismII</I></A> cards, and the latest 3Com 802.11b
cards include various chipsets (see <A HREF="#Poldhu"><I>section
28</I></A>).
<p>
The card is mostly sold in the Pcmcia form factor, along with the
Access Point. There is a PCI version that looks like a Pcmcia card in
a regular PCI to Pcmcia slot.  The main originality of Symbol is that
it offer those famous "all-in-one" products (PDA + barcode + wireless)
with 802.11-b (beware, they share the same model numbers as the
non-802.11b devices). Recently Symbol released a <B>Compact Flash</B>
(CF) version of their card called Wireless Networker which has an
amazing form factor.
<p>
The Symbol product is composed of the Intersil PrismII chipset (see
<A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>) with Symbol own MAC controller
(which is originally derived from the same core as the MAC from
Lucent, Aironet and Intersil). From Symbol, we can expect a design
giving good quality and performance.
<p>
The MAC has all the usual features of the 802.11 standard, like MAC
level retransmission, RTS/CTS, fragmentation, auto bit-rate selection,
power saving, WEP encryption and roaming, which extensive
configurability. The physical layer has the classic PrismII feature,
supporting 1, 2, 5.5 and 11&nbsp;Mb/s.

<H3>18.2	 The driver</H3>

The driver was initially written by TriplePoint, and <I>Lee</I> has
taken over the maintenance. Not surprisingly, the driver is very
similar to the Wavelan-IEEE binary driver (except for being full
source), to the point of mentioning "Turbo" cards (what Symbol calls
"High Rate").
<p>
The driver is well written, has an extensive collection of module
parameters and has been tested successfully with Symbol, 3Com and
Intel cards. <I>Lee</I> plans to add Wireless Extensions and fix the
few remaining bugs...
<p>
The version 1.01 of the driver fixes some bugs related to higher bit
rate (11 Mb/s) and encryption. The version 1.02, adds support for
kernel 2.4.X and disable power management (doesn't work on latest
firmwares).
<p>
Symbol has recently release a separate version of this driver to
support <B>Compact Flash</B> cards. Compact Flash cards need a
specific driver because they don't have the firmware stored on the
card and therefore the driver has to download the firmware to the card
after each reset.

<H3>19.1	 The device</H3>

After their success with wide area communications (GSM and co.),
Ericsson decided to expand in new markets and started looking
seriously at local connectivity. Ericsson is of course the main
driving force behind <B>BlueTooth</B> (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.std.html#mclink"><I>BlueTooth</I></A>), but they
realised pretty quickly the BlueTooth would not fulfil the need of
the Wireless LAN market. Ericsson is also pushing hard <B>HiperLAN
II</B> (see <A HREF="Linux.Wireless.std.html#Hiperlan2"><I>HiperLan
II</I></A>), a high performance system (54 Mb/s) in the 5 GHz band
with strong quality of service support.
<p>
The initial Ericsson Wireless LAN products were OEM of <B>BreezeCom
pro.11</B> products (Frequency Hopping, 3 Mb/s - see <A
HREF="#BreezeNetPC"><I>section 40</I></A>). Due to the success of
802.11-b, their second product line are fully 802.11-b compliant, and
are in fact OEM of the Symbol cards (see <A
HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 18</I></A>). As such, this product has
all the usual 802.11-b features...

<H3>19.2	 The driver</H3>

This driver apply only to the 11&nbsp;Mb/s version of the Ericsson
card. This is only the second driver written by <I>Christian</I> from
scratch, after the BreezeCom driver (see <A
HREF="#BreezeNetPC"><I>section 40</I></A> - this other driver applies
to Ericsson 3&nbsp;Mb/s cards). And as usual for him, the source code
is well written, concise and clean. Impressive job !
<p>
This driver is very new, so I don't have yet report of its use. The
driver seems to support only a minimal set of configuration and
statistics for now. <I>Christian</I> told me that it should work with
other Symbol cards with minor changes, and that the driver has been
tested with IPsec and MobileIP. I hope to have more info about it at a
later date...

</TABLE>

<H3>21.1	 The device</H3>

This is the same device as the previous entry (<A
HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 18</I></A>).
<p>
Note that this driver is specific to the <B>Compact Flash</B> (CF)
version of the card and the <B>Intel 2011B</B>.

<H3>21.2	 The driver</H3>

The Orinoco driver (see <A HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section 3</I></A>)
already includes support for regular Symbol HR cards. However, the
Compact Flash cards don't work with the standard Orinoco driver
because they lack built in firmware. This is the same reason why there
is two different Spectrum24 drivers (see <A
HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 18</I></A>).
<p>
Pavel has created a new driver based on the Orinoco driver and
Spectrum24-CF driver for those cards. It is similar to the regular
Orinoco Pcmcia driver, but add the <B>firmware download</B> at each
reset necessary for those cards. As the core of the driver is common
with the <B>Orinoco driver</B>, this driver has the exact same feature
set (which is quite extensive - see <A HREF="#Orinoco"><I>section
3</I></A>).
<p>
Note that for cards that don't require the firmware download (regular
Pcmcia cards), it is recommended to use the regular Orinoco driver
instead of this one.

<H3>22.1	 The device</H3>

The Arlan was a radio LAN, built by Aironet, using the 900MHz or
2.4GHz ISM band (Direct Sequence). This product has been
<B>discontinued</B> and replaced by the 4500 series (see below). The
Arlan comes in 3 flavour, an ISA (655), an MCA (670) and a pcmcia
(690) card (plus the access point). Later, they renamed the ISA card
IC2200 and the Pcmcia card PC2200 (still the same hardware).
<p>
The configuration include setting the frequency and Network ID (24
bits ?). The MAC protocol is implemented on a generic
microcontroler. There is two versions of the modem, a 900 MHz and a
2.4 GHz version. Both use Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum. The 900 MHz
modem allow signalling rate up to 860 kb/s (fall back to 215 kb/s) and
12 channels. The 2.4 GHz version allow signalling rate up to 2 Mb/s
(fall back to 1 Mb/s) and 5 channels.

<H3>22.2	 The driver</H3>
<I>Russell Nelson</I> told me a while ago that he was trying to
convince Aironet to release the specifications of the Arlan to develop
a Linux driver. <I>Cullen Jennings</I> started the development of a
point to point driver, <I>Elmer Joandi</I> rewrote some parts and
added a lot of features to be compatible with the Access Point,
released the whole under GPL, and here is the result.
<p>
The driver support only the ISA version of the card (655 or IC
2200). The driver have been fully tested and optimised by <I>Elmer
Joandi</I>, includes a complete /proc interface and should be soon
included in the kernel.

<H3>23.1	 The device</H3>

Aironet has been the producer of some of the most performant wireless
LANs for a long time. Aironet was a division of Telxon, and was
spun-off when Symbol, one of their competitor, did aquire
Telxon. After a short independent life, Aironet was acquired by Cisco.
<p>
The previous section was dealing with Aironet old pre-802.11 products
(see <A HREF="#Arlan"><I>section 22</I></A>), this section deals with
their more recent 802.11 compliant products. Their first 802.11
products were the 3500 family, Frequency Hopping (1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s),
and 4500, Direct Sequence (1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s).
<p>
The Arlan <B>4500</B> family is 802.11 compliant wireless LANs in the
2.4&nbsp;GHz ISM band, and is Direct Sequence. It includes an ISA,
PCI, Pcmcia, serial, Ethernet and multi-Ethernet versions, plus the
Access Point.
<p>
These cards are based on the Harris <B>Prism</B> chipset, like many
other cards (see <A HREF="#Prism"><I>section 9</I></A>), but Aironet
are using their own MAC controller. The 4500 offer standard 1 and
2&nbsp;Mb/s bit rate. The MAC includes all the standard 802.11
features, with Power Saving, WEP, Ad-Hoc mode and roaming, plus a lot
of Aironet extensions (short headers, variable base rate...). Conform
to their reputation, their MAC is one of the richest in term of
features, and one of the most performant.
<p>
The <B>3500</B> family (Frequency Hopping) eventually died, and I
won't talk about it here.
<p>
The 4500 family was quickly followed by the <B>4800</B> family, still
based on the Prism chipset, adding 5.5 and 11&nbsp;Mb/s bit rate,
either in MBOK (proprietary) or CCK, which is 802.11-b compliant. The
4800 can do encryption only at 1 and 2&nbsp;Mb/s (this limitation was
removed in the 4800B).
<p>
With introduction of the <B>PrismII</B> chipset, Aironet did release
the <B>4800B</B> family. It is functionally equivalent to the 4800,
except that the new PrismII chipset allows lower price, greater
sensitivity but force a lower transmit power (30 mW). Aironet still
use their own MAC controller in the 4800B (and not the new PrismII MAC
- see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>).
<p>
After the acquisition by Cisco, the Aironet 4800B was renamed <B>Cisco
340</B> series (exact same hardware, new name). Dell also sell the
same hardware under its own brand as <B>Dell TrueMobile 1100</B> (on
the other hand, the TrueMobile 1150 is a Wavelan IEEE).
<p>
Like Lucent, Cisco offer different cards with different level of
encryption. The cards labelled <B>340</B> feature no encryption, the
cards labelled <B>341</B> feature 40 bits encryption and the cards
labelled <B>342</B> feature 128 bits encryption. Moreover, some
versions of the Pcmcia card are sold with antenna but others without
antennas.
<p>
Cisco has now released the <B>Cisco 350</B>, a new family of 802.11b
cards. From the information I did gather, it seems to be equivalent to
the 340 series with a greater transmit power (100&nbsp;mW instead of
30&nbsp;mW). The Cisco 350 also improves the performance of the AP and
introduce greater security (Radius authentication and co).
<p>
Cisco has also release a <B>Mini-PCI (MPI)</B> version of the Aironet
350, to be added in laptops that support a Mini-PCI slot. For some
strange reason, this hardware is slightly different from the regular
Aironet 350 PCI.

<H3>23.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Ben</I> has produced a solid driver for the Aironet card, The
driver supports the ISA, PCI and Pcmcia cards (both 4500, 4800 & 4800B
versions), it looks fairly complete and debugged, with a nice /proc
interface. The driver also has very complete WEP support.
<p>
<I>Ben</I> also told me that the driver was able to recognise the
PC3500 cards, but more work would be needed there to get it fully
working.
<p>
Recently, I've started adding Wireless Extension to this
driver. <I>Ben</I> was kind enough to integrate properly my work in
his driver. Then, <I>Javier Achirica</I> did an amazing job of
completing Wireless Extension support (power management, spy and co),
and this driver has one of the most complete Wireless Extension
support of all.
<p>
Then, <I>Javier</I> added to the driver the Cisco proprietary
API, which allow communication with Cisco utilities (see <A
HREF="#ArlanCisco"><I>section 25</I></A>) and, amongst other things,
flashing new firmware on the card. All this amazing work is in the
latest release from <I>Ben</I> (1.5). He also wrote a couple of open
source utilities allowing to dump all the register of the card and to
flash new firmwares through this API.
<p>
Lately, the driver has been integrated in the Linux kernel (2.4.6 and
later) and moved to SourceForge. <I>Javier</I> has also added the
ability to dump raw 802.11 frames. Then <I>Javier</I> did extensive
work to fix locking (SMP support), add monitor mode and Wireless
Scanning support (in version 1.4).
<p>
<I>Ben</I> attempted to add support to MPI card and added code for
those cards in the CVS. Unfortunately, this work was not completed, so
the driver doesn't support yet MPI cards.

This is the same device as the previous entry (<A
HREF="#Arlan802"><I>section 23</I></A>).

<H3>24.2	 The driver</H3>

To some, it may seem that this is a totally new driver that has just
popped up in the kernel with little warning. In fact, <I>Elmer</I> had
developed this driver for a commercial company (SpectrumWireless) a
while back and they agreed to let him release it in GPL form after
some month.
<p>
The code is very complete, especially the /proc interface. It comes as
four modules, the generic core, the /proc interface, the PCI/ISA
interface and the Pcmcia interface. The driver support both the 4500
and 4800 families. Unfortunately, the Pcmcia interface is incompatible
with the Linux Pcmcia support and doesn't work well.
<p>
<I>Elmer</I> told me that compared to Ben driver, his driver was
probably more robust and featured but much less friendly. In essence,
the focus was slightly different, so each driver has it own strength.

<H3>25.1	 The device</H3>

This is the same device as the two previous entries (<A
HREF="#Arlan802"><I>section 23</I></A>).

<H3>25.2	 The driver</H3>

Recently, Cisco decided to get more involved with supporting their
Wireless LAN cards under Linux. Rather than developing an entirely new
driver, they decided to base their work on <I>Ben</I>'s driver (<A
HREF="#Arlan802"><I>section 23</I></A>), which is a good idea. One of
the key person behind this operation was <I>Jim Veneskey</I>.
<p>
The main contribution of Cisco is a proprietary API, which allow
communication with Cisco utilities and, amongst other things, flashing
new firmware on the card, and of course a set of utilities which are
mostly identical to the Windows utilities. They also provided nice
installation scripts and did lot's of testing of the driver to
guarantee its stability (Cisco usually do some pretty intensive
testing of their products).
<p>
However, even if Cisco regularly synchronise with <I>Ben</I>'s driver
(<A HREF="#Arlan802"><I>section 23</I></A>), this one continues to
improve. As they are derived from the same base, it's easy to compare
the two drivers. In term of features, I guess that <I>Ben</I>'s driver
is winning, because it now has the Cisco API of this driver and more
complete Wireless Extensions support. However, I believe that Cisco
has an edge in term of stability.
<p>
I hope that the two drivers will merge rather than diverge, and that
changes will be propagated from one to the other, so that we have a
driver with both features and rock solid stability, but only time will
tell... Cisco told me that they were going to try to catch up with
<I>Ben</I>'s driver.

<H3>26.1	 The device</H3>

The Raylink is a IEEE 802.11 FH device build by Raytheon for the 2.4
GHz ISM band. Raytheon build only a Pcmcia card and an Access
Point. I've been told that some version of the BreezeCom BreezeNet Pro
Pcmcia card was an OEM version of the Raylink.
<p>
You are more likely to buy the Raylink as a WebGear product, either as
Aviator2.4 or Aviator2.4 pro (which have nothing in common with their
old Aviator 900 MHz line). The Aviator2.4 and Aviator2.4 pro are in
fact the same product as the Raylink, the Aviator2.4 driver comes
pre-configured in ad-hoc mode and offer only the Pcmcia card, whereas
the Aviator2.4 pro driver comes preconfigured in managed mode and
offer both the Pcmcia card and the Access Point (translation seems
also to be different in each driver). Of course, it is possible to
change the mode in the driver and all these products are fully
interoperable. WebGear also offers a ISA to Pcmcia bridge to install
the Pcmcia card in desktops.
<p>
Lately, WebGear has stop selling those cards, but recently BUSlink has
started selling them again (same card, different sticker).
<p>
The Raylink delivers all the features expected from a 802.11 compliant
device, with ad-hoc networking, access point operation, authentication
and roaming. The MAC protocol is as defined in 802.11&nbsp;: CSMA/CA with
MAC level retransmissions. Configuration includes mostly the ESSID
(network name).
<p>
The modem is 2.4 GHz Frequency Hopping, with 1 Mb/s and 2 Mb/s bit
rate, and includes antenna diversity.

<h3>26.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Corey</I> has implemented a very complete driver supporting most of
the feature of the hardware and some 802.11 functionality (it should
be able to talk to some 802.11 nodes). There is an exhaustive list of
configuration parameters, a /proc interface for more parameters, and a
tool to dump 802.11 frames. Good work&nbsp;!
<p>
The new version of the driver adds Alpha support, authentication, and
compatibility with the Windows driver. SMP is slowly being
tested. I've added to the driver quite complete support for Wireless
Extension (changing parameters still doesn't work right - therefore
wireless.opts do not work).
<p>
The driver has been developed for the Raytheon Raylink and has also
been successfully tested with the WebGear Aviator2.4 and the BUSlink.
<p>
I recently improved the support for <B>Wireless Extensions</B>. It is
now possible to configure the card before the card is brought up (for
example in the various configuration files). However, it is still not
possible to change most parameters at run time (but they can always be
read).

<H3>27.1	 The device</H3>

No Wires Needed is a small company in the Netherlands building a range
of 802.11 DS devices, including a Pcmcia card (Swallow), an Access
Point and a Hub. They also offer a ISA version using a ISA to Pcmcia
bridge. They have two version, the <B>550</B> (5.5&nbsp;Mb/s) and the
more recent <B>1100</B> (11&nbsp;Mb/s). BreezeCom also EOM this card
for their DS.11 range (the <B>PC-DS.11</B>).
<p>
The Swallow delivers all the features expected from a 802.11 compliant
device, with ad-hoc networking, authentication and roaming. The main
difference with other 802.11 devices is that NWN offers some strong
link layer encryption and a key management and distribution system.
<p>
The modem is the famous Prism chipset used in many other cards (see <A
HREF="#Prism"><I>section 9</I></A>), which is 2.4 GHz Direct Sequence,
with 1&nbsp;Mb/s, 2&nbsp;Mb/s, 5.5&nbsp;Mb/s and 11&nbsp;Mb/s bit
rate. No Wires Needed use their own MAC design on an embedded ARM
processor, and not the AMD or PrismII MAC controller. This give them
more performance and flexibility. Now that Intersil has acquired No
Wires Needed, Intersil can offer 2 different 802.11 MAC
controller&nbsp;!

<H3>27.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Bas</I> has implemented a quite complete driver for the Swallow 550
and 1100 card (Pcmcia). He has patiently debugged the driver to fix
races, timeouts and increase the performance. The driver is working
for both the NWN and the BreezeCom cards.
<p>
<I>Bas</I> has also implemented Wireless Extension support for the
security support, and support the full range of security features in
the driver. You can also configure the ESSID on the fly with Wireless
Extensions...
<p>
Lately, <I>Bas</I> has been doing lot of work on roaming support. The
driver export the roaming tables in a /proc interface, allowing the
implementation of a user space roaming daemon. This interface also
contains some other configuration parameters.

<H3>28.1	 The device</H3>

Recently, No Wires Needed has replaced the Swallow 550 and 1100 with a
new 802.11-b card, the <B>1148</B>. The design and the feature of this
card seems very similar to their previous one (see <A
HREF="#Swallow"><I>section 27</I></A>)&nbsp;: The MAC is the same ARM
core and they still offer AirLock encryption. The main difference
seems that they are now using a PrismII modem (see <A
HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>).
<p>
3Com has also released a quite rare <B>old Wireless LAN XJack</B> card
(3CRWE62092A) which is a clone of the NWN 1148 (this card). On the
other hand, the newly released <B>OfficeConnect</B> Wireless LAN cards
(3CRSHPW196/696 - with or without the XJack antenna) and <B>new
Wireless LAN XJack</B> card (3CRWE62092B) are <I>Atmel</I> cards (see
<A HREF="#Atmel"><I>section 30</I></A>). The even newer
<B>OfficeConnect CardBus</B> card (3CRSHPW796) is an <I>ADMTek</I>
card (see <A HREF="#ADMtek"><I>section 33</I></A>). The older
<B>AirConnect Pcmcia</B> cards (3CRW737A/B) are clone of the <I>Symbol
HR</I> cards (see <A HREF="#Spectrum24t"><I>section 18</I></A>), and
the <B>AirConnect PCI</B> card (3CRW777A) is a <I>PrismII PLX</I> card
(see <A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>). The <B>OfficeConnect
11g</B> card (3CRWE154G72) is most likely an <I>Intersil PrismGT</I>
card (see <A HREF="#Prism54"><I>section 15</I></A>), and the
<B>11a/b/g</B> cards (3CRPAG175/3CRDAG675) are most likely
<I>Atheros</I> cards (see <A HREF="#AtherosGPL"><I>section
37</I></A>), but I don't have confirmation on those.
<p>
Coming back to the NWN 1148, the main difference between the 3Com
3CRWE62092A and NWN 1148 cards is the removal of AirLock encryption
(WEP is still available), the addition of Ad-Hoc mode, and of course
the famous pop-up antenna&nbsp;;-)

<H3>28.2	 The driver</H3>

Because the card is so similar to the Swallow, it was natural that a
driver for this card would be derived from the Swallow driver. In
fact, No Wires Needed contacted <I>Bas</I> to implement a driver for
the new card. <I>Bas</I> modified his Swallow driver and created this
driver which offer very similar functionality and feature as the
Swallow driver (see <A HREF="#Swallow"><I>section 27</I></A>).
<p>
So, the driver includes complete security support, Wireless Extensions
and roaming support. The driver also include read only support for
most low level commands (SNWNMP).
<p>
<I>Bas</I> has also added in the driver the necessary support for the
3Com WLAN XJack cards, including its specific features. All features
of the card (ad-hoc mode, encryption) are configurable through
Wireless Extensions.

<H3>29.1	 The device</H3>

In the past years, Nokia has slowly moved into the Wireless LAN
market. They started by buying <I>Intalk</I>, a company producing
PrismI clones (see <A HREF="#Prism"><I>section 9</I></A>), and Nokia
continued selling those cards, renamed Nokia <B>C020</B> and
<B>C021</B>. While being busy working on BlueTooth and HiperLanII,
Nokia didn't forget 802.11-b and released a new set of card, the
<B>C110</B> and <B>C111</B>.
<p>
As can be expected, the Nokia C110/C111 is another PrismII clone (see
<A HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>). On the other hand, it seem
that Nokia has changed quite a few things compared to the original
PrismII design, for example they have added a Smart Card reader on the
Pcmcia card (for security settings).

<H3>29.2 The driver</H3>

Nokia initially quietly made this driver available in the registered
only part of their web site and didn't mention it anywhere,
fortunately I have my spies to inform me&nbsp;;-). Later on, they moved
this driver to their official driver page on their public web
site. This driver is only for the C110/C111, on the other hand the
C020 is supposed to work with the linux-wlan package (see <A
HREF="#Prism"><I>section 9</I></A>).
<p>
The driver contains a very thin source wrapper on top of the binary
part (one version for kernel 2.2.X, one for 2.4.X). On the other hand,
the package come with exhaustive set of complex Pcmcia scripts to
configure the card and enable profiles.
<p>
The driver works in infrastructure and Ad-Hoc mode, and support WEP.

<H3>30.1	 The device</H3>

Atmel has decided to join the selected club of company selling 802.11b
chipsets. Their design is based on an ARM7 processor, and offer a
Pcmcia and a USB version. The USB version is by far the most popular,
because it was first to market. Various 802.11b radios can be used
with this chipset (such as the PrismII radio). Very little public
information is available about those products, but as they are 802.11
compliant we can expect the usual set of features.
<p>
Of course, with any USB cards the main issue is performance. The
streaming abstraction of USB doesn't work well with register/memory
based chipset designs and slow down operations. Also, USB add a
noticeable latency. I currently don't have any data on how well those
cards performs in the respect.
<p>
Linksys and D-Link are selling various USB products based on this
chipset, such as Gemtek <B>WL-280</B>, D-Link <B>DWL-120</B>, Linksys
<B>WUSB11</B>... It seems that the SMC <B>2632W</B> is a Pcmcia card
also based on the Atmel chipset.
<p>
The newly released <B>3Com OfficeConnect</B> Wireless LAN cards
(3CRSHPW196/696 - with or without the XJack antenna) and new <B>3Com
Wireless LAN XJack</B> (3CRWE62092B) are also Atmel Pcmcia cards.

<H3>30.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Atmel</I> decided to release themselves a Linux driver. This driver
is in fact a set of driver for the different combination of
controllers and radios, and was initially based on a binary
library. However, <I>Atmel</I> changed their mind and eventually
released the driver as full source GPL. The USB versions work with
both uhci and ohci USB drivers. The driver support WEP and Ad-Hoc
mode.
<p>
The package from <I>Atmel</I> include specific configuration tools
(command line and X-Window). Just after the driver was GPL'ed, the
support for Wireless Extensions was fixed and greatly enhanced by
<I>Ron</I> (Wireless Tools can now be used to configure the
card). Lately, <I>Atmel</I> has improved and enhanced the USB driver,
but also removed support for Intersil radio, so you will need to use
older version of the driver for products using Intersil radio. On the
other hand, the Pcmcia driver seems to be still based on an older
version of the code.
<p>
<I>Jason</I> and various people are hosting the driver and collecting
information about it on their web page.

<H3>31.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Oliver</I> and a group of people were not happy about the official
Atmel driver and its development (<A HREF="#Atmel"><I>section
30</I></A>), and therefore he started to write an alternate driver
from scratch, based on the information available in the official
driver, and soon those other people started to help him.
<p>
The driver support only USB devices, and it support both Intersil and
RFMD radios. At this time, the new driver is still in development, and
therefore still has some limitations, but it already support both
infrastructure and ad-hoc mode, and has some Wireless Extension
support.
<p>
As <I>Olivier</I> was no longer active, <I>J&ouml;rg</I> took over the
driver and is now fixing many bugs, making it more robust and adding a
few missing features.

<I>Simon</I> also was not happy with the original Atmel driver. He
decided to rewrite the Pcmcia/PCI driver based on the original code,
with the main target being integration in <B>kernel 2.5.X</B> (which
is now done). <I>Simon</I> did an extensive amount of work on the
driver, for example his driver has very complete Wireless Extension
support including Wireless Scanning. However, this driver is not
compliant with kernel 2.4.X and earlier.
<p>
This driver has only been tested with Pcmcia cards, if you want PCI
card support you should contact <I>Simon</I>. Some of those cards
don't have firmwares and therefore need to use the new <B>firmware
uploading</B> facility of Linux, which is currently being finalised.

<H3>33.1	 The device</H3>

ADMtek is a small taiwanese company that designed a single chip
802.11b MAC solution. Very little is known about it (for example which
radio is used with the MAC), but we can expect compliance with the
802.11b specification and the usual feature set. One of the main
feature of this chipset is that is uses a PCI busmaster interface (as
opposed to the Intersil PrismII that uses ISA PIO - <A
HREF="#Prism2"><I>section 11</I></A>), which result in much lower CPU
utilisation (and potentially higher performance).
<p>
Most <B>Cardbus 802.11b</B> cards are based on this chipset. The
chipset is starting to appear in products, such as some D-Link 802.11b
Cardbus and PCI cards, Belkin PCI cards, the SMC 2602W V2 and the 3Com
3CRSHPW796.

<H3>33.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>ADMtek</I> has released a Linux driver based on a binary library,
that can be compile for different distributions. The driver has
complete support for Wireless Extensions, and many people have
reported success using it.
<p>
<I>Eduardo</I> made a patch to add support for the 3Com 3CRSHPW796 to
this driver.

<H3>34.1	 The device</H3>

Realtek is a taiwanese company known for its Ethernet cards, which has
recently released a 802.11 chipset. This chip seems to have all the
usual 802.11 features, and offer only a PCI/CardBus interface (for
lower CPU utilisation).

<H3>34.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Realtek</I> has released a binary driver for their device, with
precompiled version for Red-Hat and SuSE. The driver doesn't use
Wireless Extension (but some private extensions), and has a strange
setup procedure (manual enable, require proper commands in the proper
sequence).
<p>
I didn't try this driver, but I got some feedback from many users. The
driver version before 1.2 were difficult to install and prone to crash
the kernel. The version 1.2 had many troubles (such as reassociation),
but was working. Version 1.3 is more stable, but a little too
talkative.

<H3>36.1	 The device</H3>

In 2001, TI (Texas Instruments) decided to make a big push on the
802.11 market. Because there was already many other 802.11 vendors, TI
needed to differentiate themselves. Their solution was to introduce a
chip with faster data rate. TI introduced a new modulation,
<B>PBCC</B> (Packet Binary Convolutional) at 5.5, 11 and 22&nbsp;Mb/s,
which offers higher speed and longer range than 802.11b modulations
(CCK).
<p>
However, to get the market to accept PBCC, TI needed the stamp of
approval of the IEEE standard group. Other vendors within the IEEE
were not keen to give TI any advantage, and decided to base 802.11g on
the OFDM modulation rather than PBCC. After much political fight, the
final <B>802.11g</B> standard include both OFDM (mandatory) and PBCC
(optional). Because PBCC is only optional and slower, I don't expect
anybody else than TI to implement it.
<p>
The <B>ACX100</B> was one of the first second generation 802.11b
chipset. It is based on a ARM7 core, and offer both a PCI/Cardbus and
USB interface. The use of PCI busmaster allow to reduce CPU
utilisation compared to 16 bit cards. The MAC includes all the common
802.11 features, the Phy implement the regular 802.11b modulations and
PBCC. The design goal seems to have been performance and features.
<p>
As soon as TI released its ACX100 chipset, many usual vendors started
selling PCI, Cardbus and USB cards based on it, for example the D-Link
520+ and 650+ cards based on it. All the cards that support
22&nbsp;Mb/s are based on this chipset.
<p>
Note that TI has release newer chipsets (TNETW1100b and TNETW1130) but
they don't seem to be products based on them yet.

<H3>36.2	 The driver</H3>

From the start, TI has refused to give any help towards a Linux driver
and have decided to totally ignore the Linux community. Toward the end
of 2002, a binary Linux driver was leaked on the net. Because this
binary driver is not officially released by any vendor, its legal
status is unclear (and therefore it is not listed here). Moreover,
this driver was compiled for a very specific kernel and was overall
very problematic to install and use.
<p>
A group of people using this driver got fed up with the situation and
decided to reverse engineer the binary driver. This is a huge task, as
this hardware and driver are fairly complex, and most other reverse
engineering project I've heard off eventually failed. After a few
month of work, they eventually released their first version of the
acx100 opensource driver.
<p>
The current driver is still in experimental stage, but it is evolving
fairly rapidly. Most basic features are now working (Ad-Hoc and
Infrastructure mode, WEP, Wireless Extensions, statistics...), and
some advanced features are implemented (monitor mode, 2.6.X
support...).

</TABLE>

<H3>37.1	 The device</H3>

Atheros was the first company to release a complete 802.11a solution,
and therefore most existing products are based on it. <B>Proxim</B>
was the first company releasing products based on the Atheros chipset,
but other familiar names such as <B>Linksys, D-Link and SMC</B> did
follow quickly.
<p>
Most vendor offer a CardBus card (32 bits Pcmcia) and Access Points,
and a few offer PCI solutions.
<p>
The first Atheros chipset, <B>ar5210</B>, implement the full
<B>802.11a</B> standard. The MAC protocol is identical to 802.11b, the
Atheros chipset offer both infrastructure and ad-hoc mode, enhanced
WEP with per link keys (for 802.1x) The radio modem use OFDM in the
5&nbsp;GHz band (8 separate channels), with speeds from 6&nbsp;Mb/s to
54&nbsp;Mb/s (depending on range).
<p>
The Atheros chipset has a few proprietary features, such as its X2
mode (turbo) that allow to double the rate by using two channels in
parallel (unfortunately, it also increases the sensitivity to
interferences, decrease the number of channels and is incompatible
with 802.11a).
<p>
The Atheros cards offer a busmaster host interface, allowing high
performance and low CPU utilisation (almost all 802.11b cards are
limited to PIO, which keeps the CPU busy). The card deals only with
the low level of the MAC protocol, and the driver has to deal with all
the 802.11 management (making driver development more
complicated). The other main characteristics of the Atheros chipset is
that it's a fully CMOS solution (including the radio), which reduces
the cost.
<p>
Atheros has released its second generation chipset, derived from the
initial ar5210, that have better performance and are no longer limited
to only 802.11a. The <B>ar5211</B> support both <I>802.11a</I> and
<I>802.11b</I>, whereas the <B>ar5212</B> support <I>802.11a</I>,
<I>802.11b</I> and <I>802.11g</I>. There is already many products on
the market using those two chipsets. In fact, it's quite hard to find
a card supporting 802.11a that doesn't include an Atheros chipset, and
many 802.11g products are also based on this Atheros chipset.

<H3>37.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>&lt;some person&gt;</I> did all the (always) tricky negotiations to
convince <I>&lt;some company&gt;</I> to give some documentation on
this chipset so that <I>Reyk</I> could write a GPL driver. <I>&lt;some
other company&gt;</I> is also supporting this project with hardware
and documentation (many thanks !). Those persons and companies want to
remain anonymous benefactors to the Linux community, but I don't want
to ignore their great contribution to the (future) driver.
<p>
<I>Reyk</I> has just started working on the driver and its initial
code is not completed and doesn't do much. I hope many people will
help him making this driver work.

<H3>38.1	 The device</H3>

This is the same device as the previous entry (<A
HREF="#AtherosGPL"><I>section 37</I></A>).

<H3>38.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Sam</I>, with the help of Atheros, had created a BSD driver for
those cards some time ago. Unfortunately, he was unable to release it
because of the FCC regulations. The Atheros hardware is basic and
doesn't enforce that valid operating parameters are set (such as
frequency and power level), however the FCC mandate that end user
should not be able to set invalid operating parameters. Eventually,
Atheros managed to find a solution that was acceptable : they create a
HAL, a binary layer that would sit between the hardware and the driver
and enforce that FCC regulations are respected. The downside is that
the HAL is available only for selected architectures (i386 only at
this point).
<p>
In the mean time, <I>Sam</I> had ported is original BSD driver to
Linux, and slowly integrated it in Linux. For example, the driver
support Wireless Extensions and Wireless Scanning. The driver requires
a recent 2.4.X kernel or 2.6.X kernel, and require Wireless Extensions
V14.
<p>
As the hardware is basic, a lot of the 802.11 functionality is handled
in the driver (as opposed to firmware). To handle this, <I>Sam</I>
ported the generic 802.11 layer from BSD into his driver. This is a
lot of code, and for the first release there is still some bugs and
many features and optimisations missing (for example, Ad-Hoc mode is
not yet functional). The good news is that over time, the performance
and functionality of this driver should increase.

<H3>39.1	 The device</H3>

The HomeFree was one of the first affordable home networking
solution. It is sold by Diamond Multimedia and designed by a small
company, Alation. The card comes in ISA, PCI and Pcmcia form factor.
<p>
To reduce the cost, Alation has used the same solution as IrDA&nbsp;: to
implement the MAC protocol in the driver instead of on the card. In
fact, they are using a IrDA chip as the baseband, and instead of
connecting it to an Ir transceiver, they use a classical 1 Mb/s
Frequency Hopping modem at 2.4 GHz.
<p>
This solution save the cost of an embedded microcontroller on the card
and allow to build a cheaper product (and to develop it faster). The
downside is that building the MAC protocol in the driver tend to
increase the protocol overhead (the MAC need more time to react to
events - this reduce throughput and increase latency) and use more
resources on the host (processor cycles and memory). In fact, this is
an effect similar to win-modems and win-printers. Also, because there
is a lot more code (which is more tightly integrated in the OS and
performance critical), the driver is more difficult to port to other
OSes (and that's why the driver below doesn't implement the HomeFree
MAC protocol).
<p>
Personally, I'm not a fan of this design, but it seems to do the job
cheaply.

<H3>39.2	 The driver</H3>

<I>Pavel</I> has developed a very simple and nice driver for the
HomeFree. The development was sponsored by PODA s.r.o., a Czech
company, which allowed Pavel to release the driver as GPL after some
time...
<p>
This driver is both very different from a standard network driver (as
the other driver I present on this page) and very different from the
HomeFree Windows driver. This driver is a straight tty interface to
the hardware (like a serial port), and doesn't implement any MAC
protocol. Therefore, it can't be interfaced directly to the standard
Linux networking stack, and is not compatible with the Windows driver.
<p>
Therefore, to use this driver, a MAC protocol of some sort is needed
(to arbitrate access to the medium, multiplex connection and ensure
reliability). <I>Pavel</I> recommend to use either some Ham protocols
such as Scarab, or to use the Linux-IrDA stack. You can also develop
you own application directly on top of this half duplex interface
(most serial applications will assume full duplex).
<p>
The advantage of that is that those protocols are very lightweight, so
usually perform much better (in term of raw throughput) than the
original HomeFree protocol, and even better than some other WLAN
products. However, those protocol (Scarab, IrDA) are not designed for
the specifics of the 2.4 GHz band and don't include all the goodies
found in 802.11. For example, IrDA allow only two nodes to be
exchanging data at one time (only one IrLAP connection active) and
deal poorly with multi nodes network. I also don't know how they deal
with co-located networks and radio interferences.
<p>
However, the most critical missing feature is regulations
compliance. The 802.11 protocol include some feature to insure
compliance with all the various regulations in the 802.11 band (such
as Frequency Hopping - usage of Radio Frequency tend to be highly <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.modem.html#ism">regulated</A>). As the driver of
<I>Pavel</I> doesn't include all these features, this driver <B>may
not be legal</B> in your country (note&nbsp;: this doesn't apply to the
Windows driver, the Windows driver is legal because Diamond has
certified it with the FCC and ETSI), and usage of this driver may
bring you big troubles (same as setting up a illegal transmitter in
the FM band). So, if you care about legislation, I advise you to check
with <I>Pavel</I> about your specific case, otherwise use at your own
risks...

<H3>40.1	 The device</H3>

The BreezeNet is a Radio LAN using the 2.4 GHz ISM band (Frequency
Hopping). The earlier versions of the Pcmcia cards were OEM of other
vendors, the old one was an OEM version of the <B>Netwave</B>, then it
was an OEM version of the <B>Raylink</B>, but their latest pro.11
Pcmcia card is <B>100&nbsp;% BreezeCom</B> (the one with two little
antenna sticks). BreezeCom has also a 802.11-b line, called DS.11, and
the Pcmcia card is a <B>No Wires Needed</B> card.
<p>
In term of protocol and modem, the Pcmcia cards are very similar to
the other BreezeCom products (see <A HREF="#BreezeNetOther"><I>section
41</I></A>). The first two Pcmcia cards were limited in term of
bit-rate (only 1&nbsp;Mb/s), and have lower transmit power.

<H3>40.2	 The driver</H3>

The driver presented here apply only to the latest pro.11 Pcmcia
card. For the old Pcmcia card (not pro), you may use the
<B>newave_cs</B> driver (in all good Pcmcia packages). For the first
pro.11 Pcmcia card, you may use the <B>ray_cs</B> driver (in recent
Pcmcia packages - and therefore get 802.11 compliance). For the DS.11
card (802.11-b compliant), you may use the <B>swallow_cs</B> driver.
<p>
BreezeCom has also release a Linux driver for their latest pro.11
card. I've been informed of the existence of this driver since October
99, and many people have been using it since by getting it directly
from BreezeCom, but BreezeCom did release this driver to the wide
public only 6 months later. Let's not complain, because the driver
contains the full source and is now GPL, so it was worth the wait !
<p>
The driver was written by <I>Christian Olrog</I>, an employee of
Ericsson, based on the original Windows driver source, and it seems
that the maintenance has been taken over by <I>Alfred Cohen</I> of
BreezeCom. The source code looks very nice and complete, with only a
few features missing. One interesting feature is that the driver can
show the signal strength for Access Points in the area. However, the
initial configuration could be simpler...
<p>
The driver has been in use by many Linux users since its original
development and there doesn't seem to have been much complains about
it, which is good ;-)
<p>
The original version of the driver, 1.0, is only for Linux kernel
2.2.X. There is a beta version of the driver for Linux kernel 2.4.X.

<H3>41.1	 The device</H3>

The BreezeNet is a Radio LAN using the 2.4 GHz ISM band (Frequency
Hopping). It is built by BreezeCom, a small company from Israel, and
some OEM version might be available. The BreezeNet doesn't connect to
any of the usual PC bus but instead uses an Ethernet network card to
interface to the host computer, and so require no driver to work (they
have also some real access points). For the Pcmcia hardware, see
above.
<p>
There is three versions of the BreezeNet, the old one, somewhat
Netwave compatible, then the first pro.11 version (flash upgradable to
802.11) and the new pro.11 version, which is 802.11 compliant, so with
all the usual MAC features expected from 802.11 devices. In all cases
the modem includes Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (20&nbsp;ms hop
period), a 3&nbsp;Mb/s signalling rate (fall back to 2 and
1&nbsp;Mb/s) and antenna diversity. Note that the 3&nbsp;Mb/s bit rate
is not 802.11 compliant.
<p>
BreezeCom now offers a DS.11 series of adapters which is 802.11-b
compliant, with usual 802.11-b features (and up to 11&nbsp;Mb/s) and still
using the Ethernet interface.
<p>
In 2001, BreezeCom and Floware Wireless Systems merged together to
form Alvarion. The new combined company seems to put less emphasis on
wireless LANs and more on point-to-point links and wireless
distributions systems, even though the old BreezeNet product lines are
still available.

<H3>41.2	 The driver</H3>

No driver is needed, this product use an Ethernet connection. You need
to have an dedicated Ethernet 10baseT card configured under Linux to
plug it into. For the device configuration and statistics, unless
someone write the necessary tools for Linux, I guess that you must
return to DOS/Windows.

</A>

<B>Netwave AirSurfer plus</B> (in 802.11 mode), <B>BayStack
650</B>&nbsp;: Now that a driver for the BayStack 660 is available, it
should be quite easy to make a driver for those cards, by reusing the
physical layer parts in the AirSurfer plus driver. FreeBsd seems to
have a driver for this device...
<p>
<B>RadioLan</B> has a 10 Mb/s at 5 GHz product, rather very short
range and no Linux drivers.
<p>
<B>WebGear Aviator 900 MHz</B>&nbsp;: connect to the parallel port and
offer cable replacement solution. No functional Linux driver yet.
<p>
The <B>IBM Wireless LAN Entry</B> is a discontinued product that may
be sometime found for a very very low price. Unfortunately, there is
no working driver for those and information on the device is
impossible to find.
<p>
Cards based on the <B>Broadcom</B> chipset (802.11b or 802.11g) are
not supported, and Broadcom seems to not respond to inquiries about
Linux, despite listing Linux in their product documentation.

<H2>43	A note on driver licenses</H2>

<I>Donald Becker</I>'s web page alerted me on the <B>license and
copyright</B> issues for networking drivers (see <A
HREF="http://www.scyld.com/expert/modules.html#legal">
http://www.scyld.com/expert/modules.html#legal</A> for details). If
you just plan to use the driver in your Linux PC, there should be no
problem, but if you plan other use of the drivers you should pay
attention to the exact license the driver come in.
<p>
Most drivers are <B>GPL</B>, which prevent their use with non-GPL
kernels (so commercial operating systems can't reuse the code) and
prevent to use portions of the source in non-GPL drivers, except with
the explicit authorisation from the author.
<p>
Some other drivers come with a <B>binary library</B>, which restrict
its potential use (the driver can't be ported to other architectures).
<p>
This may be tough, but those people have spend long nights and week
ends convincing the hardware manufacturer to release information,
writing and debugging the code, so please respect their copyrights and
decisions.

<H2>44	More information on the devices, other Wireless LANs</H2>

You will notice that I don't give too much information on the
different devices. The web page of each <B>vendors</B> usually contain
the full specification of the products they sell.
<p>
They are many more products available than the ones that I've listed
(which are the most common). If your favourite wireless LAN is not
listed above, either there is no driver under Linux that I know of, or
it is an <B>OEM</B> version of one of these (same hardware under a new
brand).
<p>
To have a good picture of all the devices available and their
characteristics, you should redirect your favourite browser to&nbsp;:

<H2>45	Other Wireless technologies</H2>
</A>

<H3>45.1	Wireless bridges</H3>
<B>Wireless bridges</B> allow to connect different networks via radio,
their goal is to replace a dedicated leased line (T1, for
example). They usually offer longer distance through <B>directional
antennas</B>, and are peer to peer.
<p>
These devices are a totally independent box (like other bridges,
routers or gateways) and not a card to plug in your PC, so have no
interactions with Linux.

<H3>45.2	Radio Amateur and AX25 (HAM)</H3>
These devices are quite specific and are described in their own <I>
howto</I>.

<H3>45.3	Infrared</H3>

Apart from the remote control stuff, most infrared devices are
<B>IrDA</B> compliant. IrDA defines a full lightweight protocol stack
on top of very cheap and simple hardware, and is optimal for short
ad-hoc transactions (using Obex for example). TCP/IP networking over
IrDA can be done using <B>PPP over IrComm</B>, <B>IrLAN</B> or
<B>IrNET</B> (all of them point-to-point solutions).
<p>
More information on IrDA for Linux is available at :

<p>
There is also some real Wireless LANs using diffuse infrared (no more
peer to peer), but I don't have much information on these.

<H3>45.4	BlueTooth</H3>

<B>BlueTooth</B> is a radio standard heavily influenced by IrDA and
USB, and offers the functionality of a wireless USB and serial cable
replacement (see <A
HREF="Linux.Wireless.std.html#mclink"><I>BlueTooth</I></A> for a more
complete description). BlueTooth defines its own protocol stack as
well, and offers the possibility to create long term binding between
devices (attach wirelessly peripherals to a phone or a PDA). TCP/IP
networking over BlueTooth can be done using <B>PPP over RfComm</B> or
<B>PAN</B> (BNEP).

<H3>45.5	Digital mobile phones and other radio WAN</H3>

Again, this is quite different from Wireless LANs. I don't know much
about those devices, except the usual generalitie.
<p>
<B>Digital mobile phones</B> (<I>GSM, TDMA, CDMA, PHS</I>) very often
allow data connections (slow and expensive). Most of them offer a
standard serial interface with an extended AT command set, so can be
configured like a normal modem&nbsp;: PPP over the serial port.
<p>
Some Nokia GSM phones use a kind of half winmodem interface where the
upper layer handling is done by the host. For these phones you need
<B>gnokii</B> (<A
HREF="http://gnokii.org">http://gnokii.org</A>). This package also
provide tools to play with various extra features of the phone (SMS,
address book...).
<p>
Of course, the ultimate geek challenge is to use IrDA (see <A
HREF="#other"><I>section 45.3</I></A>) to connect your mobile phone to
your laptop. That's done with PPP over IrComm or gnokii.
<p>
In most cases, <B>Wireless WANs</B> such as <I>CDPD</I> cards, the
<I>Metricom Ricochet</I> and <I>ARDIS</I> should use modem interface
as well.
